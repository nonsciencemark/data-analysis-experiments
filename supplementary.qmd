## Sampling regime {#sec-sampling_times}

### Ciliate

Due to the large differences in cilate population dynamics, the sampling differed between species. Furthermore, since the most important information required to fit growth curves was towards the start of the experiment (in the exponential growth phase), sampling was more frequent at the beginning of the experiment and then declined in frequency as the populations stabilised. *Tetrahhymena* strains were sampled twice a day during the first week at 09:00 and 17:00. All other species were sampled once a day during the first week at 13:00. During the second week, all species were sample once a day at 13:00. During the third week, all species were sampled every second day at 13:00. Finally, during the fourth and fifth weeks, all species were sampled twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays at 13:00.

### Cyanobacteria

The cyanobacteria microcosms were sampled every day at the same time for each microcosm: between 09:00 and 13:00 depending on the population, as the sampling procedure took some time. Additionally, each microcosm of the cyanobacteria system had three replicates.

### Growth and trait change

The ciliate populations grew logistically in all conditions, approaching a roughly stable state by the end of the experiment (@fig-cilia-pop-traits-time). The final population densities differed greatly between genera, with *Tetrahymena* reaching densities an order of magnitude greater than the others.

![Log-transformed populations and trait changes over time for the ciliate system. The traits show the mean values in the sampled population at each time point. Size indicates the top-down area of the cell in \textmu$\mathrm{m}^{2}$. Speed indicates the average movement speed in \textmu$\mathrm{m \, s}^{-1}$. Aspect ratio is the ratio of the longest cell dimension relative to the shortest. Linearity indicates the cell movement linearity i.e. a value of 1 is perfectly linear while a value of 0 is Brownian motion. Trait indicates the aggregate trait - the first axis of a PCA fitted across the four measured traits for each strain and treatment combination.](figures/cilia_pop-traits-time.png){#fig-cilia-pop-traits-time width="6in"}

The cyanobacteria populations grew logistically in the control and temperature treatments, but maintained stable or slightly-decreased populations in the atrazine and atrazine-temperature treatments (@fig-cyano-pop-traits-time).

Measured traits (size, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin) are expressed in arbitrary units. Size is proportional to the cell diameter, and the three pigment channels are defined by their excitation and fluorescence (see supporting information).

Individual traits (and therefore the aggregate trait) changed substantially throughout the experiment for both the ciliate and cyanobacteria systems (@fig-cilia-pop-traits-time, @fig-cyano-pop-traits-time). These aggregate traits also contained the majority of the trait variation, and well-summarised the four functional traits of each study system into a single variable (@fig-PC-var-explained, @fig-PC-var-explained)

These values indicate how much information is kept when the traits are combined into a single aggregate trait. The horizontal dashed line indicates the mean explained variance across all strains and treatments ($53.6\%$).](figures/PC_var_explained.pdf){#fig-PC-var-explained}

Populations of both systems exhibited mostly nonzero intrinsic growth and negative density-dependence (@fig-cilia-td-general, @fig-cyano-td-general). Intrinsic growth rates of *Tetrahymena* strains were consistently higher than that of the other strains and *Spirostomum* strains exhibited stronger negative density-dependence (i.e. stronger self-limitation). Environmental conditions had moderate and variable effects on how ciliate populations grew. In the cyanobacteria system, intrinsic growth and density-dependence were comparable across strains (@fig-cyano-pcgr). However, environmental conditions had greater effects on these parameters; the addition of atrazine substantially reduced intrinsic growth rates (to the point of being negative in cases).

The traits of both systems exhibited generally negative trait-dependence (@fig-cilia-td-general, @fig-cyano-td-general). In the ciliate system, intrinsic trait change (@fig-cilia-dT) was generally not significantly different from zero, but estimates varied across environmental conditions in *Tetrahymena* strains. The trait-dependence of trait change in ciliates was also strongest for these strains. In the cyanobacteria system, intrinsic trait change was often significantly different from zero and mostly positive (@fig-growth-dtrait).

## Model goodness-of-fit

### Ciliate

![The coefficient of determination i.e., r-squared, for the cilia and cyanobacteria system models. The mean values across strains and treatments are shown by the horizontal dashed lines.](figures/R2.pdf){#fig-R2}

In the ciliate system, the $R^2$ of the model fit was generally below 0.5 for both growth and trait changes for all treatments and was generally unaffected by whether the single- or both-predictor model was used (@fig-R2). *Tetrahymena* strains were generally better-fitting but still without substantial model support. In the cyanobacteria system, the treatments without atrazine were substantially better-fitting than those with atrazine added (@fig-R2). Additionally, while the goodness-of-fit of the growth predictions were only marginally improved by the addition of the full model, the trait change predictions were greatly improved by including the full model.
