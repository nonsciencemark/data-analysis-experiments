title: "Environment- and system-specific interactions between traits and population growth"
abstract-title: "Abstract"
abstract: >
  **Abstract:** Understanding the factors that influence population dynamics across environmental contexts is essential to predict ecological stability. Functional traits influence population growth, which can in turn influence traits and thus create a feedback between population and trait dynamics. We analysed the reciprocal connections between population and trait dynamics in two microbial systems (one autotrophic and one heterotrophic system) and across a range of environmental conditions. When augmenting models of population (trait) dynamics with trait (population density) data, we found no consistent improvement of predictive capacity: this improvement was environment- and system-dependent. Notably, in the cyanobacteria system, models augmented with population density did predict trait dynamics better. In addition, when augmented models were superior, the improvement was substantial. Further investigation of the environmental dependence of trait-growth relationships is recommended.
