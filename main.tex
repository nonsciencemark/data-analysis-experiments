\textbf{Abstract:} Understanding the factors that influence population
dynamics across environmental contexts is essential to predict
ecological stability. Functional traits influence population growth,
which can in turn influence traits and thus create a feedback between
population and trait dynamics. We analysed the reciprocal connections
between population and trait dynamics in two microbial systems (one
autotrophic and one heterotrophic system) and across a range of
environmental conditions. When augmenting models of population (trait)
dynamics with trait (population density) data, we found no consistent
improvement of predictive capacity: this improvement was environment-
and system-dependent. Notably, in the cyanobacteria system, models
augmented with population density did predict trait dynamics better. In
addition, when augmented models were superior, the improvement was
substantial. Further investigation of the environmental dependence of
trait-growth relationships is recommended.
\end{abstract}
\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec-DAE_introduction}

Forecasting ecological change requires an understanding of population
dynamics, the trajectory of population density through time. A prime
predictor of a population's growth rate is its current density.
Density-dependence of population growth is generally negative,
stimulating growth at low density, and limiting it when density gets
high, which effectively puts a cap on population size. Since the classic
experiments by Gause (\citeproc{ref-Gause1934}{1934}) and Gill
(\citeproc{ref-Gill1972}{1972}), evidence of negative density-dependence
is abundant across biological systems (\citeproc{ref-Sibly2005}{Sibly et
al. 2005}). However, means of functional traits across individuals in a
population have also been proposed as essential predictors of population
growth (\citeproc{ref-Ozgul2012}{Ozgul et al. 2012};
\citeproc{ref-Edwards2013}{Edwards, Litchman, and Klausmeier 2013};
\citeproc{ref-Perez-Ramos2019}{PÃ©rez-Ramos et al. 2019};
\citeproc{ref-Litchman2008}{Litchman and Klausmeier 2008};
\citeproc{ref-Violle2007}{Violle et al. 2007}).

One challenge when using traits to predict population dynamics is that
traits are not static but dynamic. Rapid trait change is widespread
(\citeproc{ref-Ellner2011}{Ellner, Geber, and Hairston 2011}) and, while
trait change caused by environmental change is arguably studied more
often (\citeproc{ref-Grainger2021}{Grainger and Levine 2021}), traits
can also change as a result of population density
(\citeproc{ref-Gibert2022}{Gibert et al. 2022}). This can happen when
population density is strongly-connected to demographic descriptors
(e.g.~size structure \citeproc{ref-Gillooly2001}{Gillooly et al. 2001};
\citeproc{ref-Brown2004}{Brown et al. 2004};
\citeproc{ref-DeLong2015}{DeLong et al. 2015};
\citeproc{ref-Wieczynski2021}{Wieczynski et al. 2021}). In addition, the
trait value itself can be expected to determine trait change, too. This
becomes clear when considering body size, often used as a master trait
predicting population dynamics (\citeproc{ref-Litchman2008}{Litchman and
Klausmeier 2008}). Energetic and physiological costs associated with
body size limit an individual's growth (\citeproc{ref-Frank2009}{Frank
2009}; \citeproc{ref-Schmidt-Nielsen1984}{Schmidt-Nielsen 1984};
\citeproc{ref-Haldane1926}{Haldane 1926}) in much the same way as
population size limits population growth. Two candidate predictors of
trait change therefore stand out: population density and the trait value
itself. Both population growth and trait change therefore represent a
dynamical system of coupled variables. This coupling can create
feedbacks, and is therefore important to unravel if we are to predict
the fate of populations subject to perturbations. One way to formalize
this interdependence of population and trait dynamics is as follows
(\citeproc{ref-Patel2018}{Patel, Cortez, and Schreiber 2018}):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-Patel}{\begin{split}
        \frac{\text{d}N}{N\text{d}t} & = f(N, T) \\
        \frac{\text{d}T}{\text{d}t} & = g(N, T), \\
    \end{split}
}\end{equation}

where \(N\) and \(T\) are the population density and mean trait value
across individuals in a population, and \(f\) and \(g\) are functions
describing the effects of these two predictors on the dynamics of
population density and traits. Note that this framework is general; the
functions \(f\) and \(g\) could capture a variety of biological
mechanisms, including resource competition, and behavioural, epigenetic,
or genetic change. In the context of Equation~\ref{eq-Patel}, the
feedback between population and trait dynamics is captured by the
dependence of \(f\) on \(T\) and of \(g\) on \(N\). If either dependence
is zero, feedback is lost.

Environmental conditions can affect population growth and traits. For
example, increases in temperature favour smaller cell size in plankton
(\citeproc{ref-Fernandez-Gonzalez2021}{FernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez and MaraÃ±Ã³n
2021}). Furthermore, interactions between growth and traits can be
environment-dependent as well, as environmental factors such as
temperature have been shown to modulate how traits affect growth
(\citeproc{ref-Brown2004}{Brown et al. 2004};
\citeproc{ref-Gillooly2001}{Gillooly et al. 2001};
\citeproc{ref-Kremer2017a}{Kremer, Thomas, and Litchman 2017}). One can
therefore expect that feedbacks will be environment-dependent, as well
as differing among model systems. In systems where the observed traits
have a unequivocal contribution to energy or resource acquisition, these
relationships are expected to be stronger. A prime example of such
systems are primary producers, where traits making up leaf architecture
or pigmentation have a direct link to light and carbon fixation and
therefore fitness and population growth (\citeproc{ref-Chin2023}{Chin et
al. 2023}). In such systems, trait information may be essential to
correctly predict population dynamics (\citeproc{ref-Stomp2004}{Stomp et
al. 2004}). How the reciprocal effects (of density on traits) differ
between systems is less intuitive, however, and will depend on the
capacity and speed of the trait change.

Here, we investigate the reciprocal links between population and trait
dynamics in two different microbial systems (ciliates and cyanobacteria)
across several environmental conditions. To this end, we performed
microcosm experiments where we monitored population densities and trait
values over time. Given these data, we first asked whether augmenting a
model of density-dependence with traits improved predictions of
population growth. Similarly, we then tested whether augmenting a model
of trait-dependence with population density improved predictions of
trait change. Finally, we asked whether the contributions of traits and
density to population and trait dynamics, respectively, depend on the
environmental context and/or differ between the two model systems.

We found limited evidence to support general feedbacks between
population and trait dynamics. Improvements to predictions of these
dynamics by including both trait values and population densities was
system- and environment-specific. In cases when the augmented model
outperformed the single-state model, the prediction increase was
substantial.

\subsection{Materials and Methods}\label{sec-DAE_methods}

\subsubsection{Experiments}\label{experiments}

\paragraph{Study systems}\label{study-systems}

We addressed these research questions using a number of unicellular,
clonally-reproducing strains from two model systems: seven strains from
four ciliate genera and four strains from two ecotypes of the
picocyanobacteria genus \emph{Synechococcus}
(\citeproc{ref-Farrant2016}{Farrant et al. 2016};
\citeproc{ref-Grebert2018}{GrÃ©bert et al. 2018};
\citeproc{ref-Sohm2016}{Sohm et al. 2016}). The ciliate genera are
globally-distributed freshwater mixotrophs
(\citeproc{ref-Weisse2022}{Weisse and Montagnes 2022};
\citeproc{ref-Lu2021}{Lu, Gao, and Weisse 2021}) and
\emph{Synechococcus} makes up a substantial proportion of marine
phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis
(\citeproc{ref-Dvorak2014}{DvoÅÃ¡k et al. 2014}). Both study systems
harbor considerable diversity, as the freshwater ciliates span several
taxonomic orders and the polyphyetic \emph{Synechoccocus} has a similar
order-level diversity, while, however, being less well-defined
phylogenetically due to the frequency of horizontal gene transfer events
(\citeproc{ref-Salazar2020}{\textbf{Salazar2020?}};
\citeproc{ref-Dvorak2015}{DvoÅÃ¡k et al. 2015};
\citeproc{ref-Zhaxybayeva2006}{Zhaxybayeva et al. 2006}).

The ciliate strains selected exhibit substantial diversity in their
functional traits and demography - \emph{Spirostomum} is a large,
elongate, and slow-growing while \emph{Tetrahymena} is small, more
rounded, and faster-growing - and they therefore span a broad range of
ecological niches. Similarly, the \emph{Synechoccocus} strains are
selected from two different ``ecotypes'' that characterise their
pigmentation and biogeography (\citeproc{ref-Stomp2007a}{Stomp et al.
2007}; \citeproc{ref-Sohm2016}{Sohm et al. 2016};
\citeproc{ref-Grebert2018}{GrÃ©bert et al. 2018}).

We examined density-dependence and trait-dependence across a range of
environmental conditions, represented here by temperature and a
pollutant --- both commonly-encountered environmental pressures in
natural systems. Specifically, we consider an ``altered'' environment to
have increased temperature, increased concentration of a pollutant, or
both. Both of these pressures are linked to human activity. Temperature
change is ubiquitously-relevant as anthropogenically-driven climate
change continues to intensify. We used atrazine as the pollutant.
Atrazine is present in many aquatic ecosystems via agricultural run-off,
represents a broad class of herbicides that act via the inhibition of
photosynthesis, and also induces oxidative stress in heterotrophic
organisms (e.g.~ciliates), reducing their fitness
(\citeproc{ref-Shim2022}{Shim et al. 2022}). Control conditions are
hereafter indicated by ``C'', temperature changes by ``T'', atrazine
changes by ``A'', and the combined atrazine and temperature changes by
``AT''.

We grew the strains in monoculture for sufficient time for them to reach
their carrying capacity, enabling us to quantify their intrinsic growth
rate and density-dependence. Population densities and trait values were
measured at regular, frequent intervals
(Table~\ref{tbl-treatment_table}, \textbf{?@sec-sampling\_times}).

\paragraph{Experimental setup}\label{experimental-setup}

For the ciliate system, the microcosms consisted of 250 mL square
bottles with vented caps (DURANÂ®) containing 100 mL nutrient medium,
inoculated with enough cells to initiate population growth. We obtained
the required cell density by a injecting a species-specific volume of
1-week old preculture into new medium (100 \textmu L, 5 mL, 10 mL, and
10 mL for \emph{Tetrahymena thermophila}, \emph{Loxocephalus} sp.,
\emph{Paramecium caudatum} and \emph{Spirostomum teres}, respectively).
The microcosms were kept in an incubator with a 10:14h light/dark cycle.
The nutrient medium consisted of Chalkey's solution supplemented with
crushed protist pellets (Carolina biological supply; 0.55
\(\mathrm{gL}^{-1}\)), filtered through a 0.22 \textmu m filter system
(BT50 500 mL) to remove all particulate matter and consecutively
bacterized with \emph{Bacillus brevis}, \emph{Brevibacillus subtilis}
and \emph{Serratia fonticola}. Following bacterization, the medium was
incubated for two days at 20Â°C on a shaker to allow the bacteria to grow
before ciliates were added. During the experiment, we replaced 20\% of
the medium every third day by replacing 4 mL culture with 4 mL 5x
concentrated unbacterized nutrient medium, supplemented with atrazine as
needed.

For the cyanobacteria system, the microcosms consisted of 6 mL six-well
plates (Sarstedt standard flat 6 well plate, 83.3920) of PCRS-11 Red Sea
medium (\citeproc{ref-Rippka2000}{Rippka et al. 2000}), inoculated at
5000 cells \(\mathrm{mL}^{-1}\) inside temperature-controlled incubators
(Lovibond Thermostatic Cabinet). They were cultured in white light
(6500K LedAquaristik Sky Bar) in a 12:12h light/dark cycle. The six-well
plates were constantly mixed 150 RPM with a VWR mini shaker.

Growth media were adjusted to include the appropriate amount of atrazine
and microcosms were kept at a constant temperature throughout. All
sampling was undertaken in sterile environments to prevent
contamination.

\paragraph{Sampling procedure}\label{sampling-procedure}

Population densities and traits were measured using procedures
specifically designed for each species: imaging for ciliates and flow
cytometry for cyanobacteria.

Ciliate microcosms were sampled by digital dark-field imaging using an
much updated version of the method described by Pennekamp and
Schtickzelle (\citeproc{ref-Pennekamp2013}{2013}). For each microcosm,
at each sample time, a series of pictures was taken of a 810 \textmu L
sub-sample using a Sony A9 camera equipped with an FE 90 mm F2.8 Macro G
OSS lens and a dark-field approach (indirect light and black
background). Each series consisted of 10 second burst shots at 10 fps in
grey scale (other settings: 1/160s, F11, ISO 6400), resulting in 100
pictures per sample. We then proceeded with automated image analysis
using Fiji (\citeproc{ref-Schindelin2012}{Schindelin et al. 2012};
\citeproc{ref-VanRossum2022}{Van Rossum 2022}) to count, track, and
characterize the traits of all moving particles i.e.~cell size (area),
cell shape (aspect ratio), movement speed, and movement linearity in the
sample (\citeproc{ref-Pennekamp2014}{Pennekamp et al. 2014}). The traits
were population averages of cell size, cell aspect ratio, linearity of
the cell's movement, and movement speed. Cell morphology influences the
maintenance requirement and resource uptake rates and the motility
traits affect the encounter rate of ciliates for their bacterial
resources.

Cyanobacteria microcosms were sampled using a flow cytometer (Guava
easyCyte 12HT) that measures cell densities and trait values using
several channels, which correspond to specific excitation and
fluorescence combinations by lasers and detectors. The flow cytometer
channels correspond approximately to cell size and concentration of
three photosynthetic pigments present in \emph{Synechococcus}:
chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin. At each sampling time, 57
\textmu  L of distilled water was added to counteract evaporation. Then,
200 \textmu L of the 6 mL microcosm was removed and replaced with 200
\textmu L of fresh medium. This 200 \textmu L sample of the culture was
diluted with distilled water to be between 50 and 500 cells
\textmu \(\mathrm{L}^{-1}\), the concentration range for which the flow
cytometer gives accurate measurements, and 200 \textmu L of the
appropriately-diluted sample was put into a 96-well plate and processed
by the flow cytometer. The flow cytometer then measures 1000 cells from
each well to determine the cell density and measure the trait values.
The traits were population averages of several flow cytometer channels,
indicative of cell size and concentrations of chlorophyll-a,
phycocyanin, \& phycoerythrin. Cell size again influences resource
uptake and maintenance and the photosynthetic pigments influence the
light absorption (\citeproc{ref-Maranon2015}{MaraÃ±Ã³n 2015};
\citeproc{ref-Stomp2007a}{Stomp et al. 2007}). Sampled debris, dead
cells, and doublets were removed from the analysed data using the
CyanoFilter and PeacoQC packages in R version 2.3.1
(\citeproc{ref-Olusoji2021}{Olusoji et al. 2021};
\citeproc{ref-PeacoQC}{Emmaneel 2022}; \citeproc{ref-RCoreTeam2023}{R
Core Team 2023}).

\subsubsection{Analyses}\label{analyses}

The objectives of our analyses were to investigate whether we could best
predict the population per-capita growth rate (hereafter ``growth'',
\(\gamma\)) from density only, or if augmenting our prediction using
trait data improved this prediction in our model systems. Similarly, we
tested if augmenting this model using trait data to predict trait change
(hereafter \(\tau\)) with density data improved predictive capacity.

Since there were multiple traits to incorporate, we first summarised the
traits into a single aggregate trait (hereafter ``trait'') using a
principal component analysis, PCA, per strain and treatment. This
eliminates the impact of trait covariance and collinearity, and ensures
that trait information is represented by a single variable, as is
population density. We use only the first component of this PCA to
represent the traits, which contains most of the explained variance
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_PC_var_explained},
Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_PC_var_explained}).

We calculated, for all combinations of strains and environmental
conditions, the growth rate at each time point,
\(\gamma_t=\Delta^{-1}\textrm{log}(N_{t+\Delta}/N_t)\), where \(N\) is
population density and \(\Delta\) is the time between consecutive
sampling times. We then fitted two linear models, for all combinations
of strains and environmental conditions, of \(\gamma_t\) against
\(N_t\):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-pcgr}{
\gamma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 N_t,
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-pcgrExtd}{
\gamma_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 N_t + \beta_2 T_t,
}\end{equation}

where \(N_t\) (density, continuous) and \(T_t\) (trait value,
continuous) are predictors, and the \(\beta_i\) are regression
coefficients. The first model, Equation~\ref{eq-pcgr}, is the standard
model of linear, density-dependent growth. The second model,
Equation~\ref{eq-pcgrExtd}, is the model augmented with trait data.

Similarly, for all combinations of strains and environmental conditions,
the trait rate of change at each time point \(\tau_t\), as
\(\tau_t=\Delta^{-1}(T_{t+\Delta}-T_{t})\), where \(T\) is the trait
value, and \(\Delta\) is again the time between consecutive sampling
times. We again fitted two models, but now using the trait values as the
response variables:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-dT}{
\tau_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_t,
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-dTExtd}{
\tau_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_t + \beta_2 N_t,
}\end{equation}

where \(N_t\) (density, continuous) and \(T_t\) (trait value,
continuous) are predictors, and the \(\beta_i\) are regression
coefficients. Again, Equation~\ref{eq-dTExtd} is the augmented version
of Equation~\ref{eq-dT}.

With these models at hand, we then tested whether the the augmented
model improved predictions of population/trait dynamics by comparing the
prediction accuracy of the augmented models relative to the basic
models. We compared the AIC of these models to determine which model
best predicted the data, transforming these AIC values into Akaike
scores representing the probability that the augmented models
(Equation~\ref{eq-pcgrExtd}, Equation~\ref{eq-dTExtd}) were better than
the basic models (Equation~\ref{eq-pcgr}, Equation~\ref{eq-dT})
(\citeproc{ref-Wagenmakers2004}{Wagenmakers and Farrell 2004};
\citeproc{ref-Burnham2004}{Burnham and Anderson 2004}). Finally, in
conjunction with the likelihood that the augmented model was best, we
compared the relative change in predictive accuracy, relative to the
single-variable model, using the coefficient of determination
(R-squared).

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-DAE_results}

\subsubsection{Growth and trait change}\label{growth-and-trait-change}

The ciliate populations grew logistically in all conditions, approaching
a roughly stable state by the end of the experiment
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_pop_traits_time}). The final population densities
differed greatly between genera, with \emph{Tetrahymena} reaching
densities an order of magnitude greater than the others.

\end{figure}

The cyanobacteria populations grew logistically in the control and
temperature treatments, but maintained stable or slightly-decreased
populations in the atrazine and atrazine-temperature treatments
(Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_pop_traits_time}).

\end{figure}

Individual traits (and therefore the aggregate trait) changed
substantially throughout the experiment for both the ciliate and
cyanobacteria systems (Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_pop_traits_time},
Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_pop_traits_time}). These aggregate traits also
contained the majority of the trait variation, and well-summarised the
four functional traits of each study system into a single variable
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_PC_var_explained},
Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_PC_var_explained})

explained variance across all strains and treatments (\(79.5\%\)).}

\end{figure}

Populations of both systems exhibited mostly nonzero intrinsic growth
and negative density-dependence (\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_td\_general},
\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_td\_general}). Intrinsic growth rates of
\emph{Tetrahymena} strains were consistently higher than that of the
other strains and \emph{Spirostomum} strains exhibited stronger negative
density-dependence (i.e.~stronger self-limitation). Environmental
conditions had moderate and variable effects on how ciliate populations
grew. In the cyanobacteria system, intrinsic growth and
density-dependence were comparable across strains
(\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_pcgr}). However, environmental conditions had
greater effects on these parameters; the addition of atrazine
substantially reduced intrinsic growth rates (to the point of being
negative in cases).

The traits of both systems exhibited generally negative trait-dependence
(\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_td\_general}, \textbf{?@fig-cyano\_td\_general}).
In the ciliate system, intrinsic trait change (\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_dT})
was generally not significantly different from zero, but estimates
varied across environmental conditions in \emph{Tetrahymena} strains.
The trait-dependence of trait change in ciliates was also strongest for
these strains. In the cyanobacteria system, intrinsic trait change was
often significantly different from zero and mostly positive
(\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_growth\_dtrait}).

\subsubsection{Model selection}\label{model-selection}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figures/cilia/cilia_AIC.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cilia_AIC}Differences in model performance when
adding traits or density to predict growth (top panel) or trait change

horizontal dashed lines. Values greater than 0.5 indicate that the full
model is likely to be better, values less than 0.5 indicate that the
single-variable model is likely to better, and values around 0.5
indicate that the two models are approximately equal.}

\end{figure}

In the ciliate system, using the augmented model (including both traits
and population densities) to predict growth/trait change generally did
not improve predictions (Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC_deltaerror}). For
predictions of growth, only in a few cases (particularly
\emph{Tetrahymena} strains and \emph{Loxocephalus} 1) was the augmented
model more likely in some environmental conditions. Predictions of trait
change with the augmented model were even less likely to outperform the
trait-only model.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figures/cyano/cyano_AIC.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cyano_AIC}As Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC} but for the
cyanobacteria system.}

\end{figure}

In the cyanobacteria system, for treatments without atrazine, the
augmented models were generally notably better at predicting the system
dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_AIC}). For predictions of population
growth, the augmented model was generally likely to best describe the
data, with some exceptions in which the added trait data provided no
benefit to predictions. For predictions of trait change, the augmented
model was more consistently more likely to be better, with only some
cases in the treatments with atrazine where it failed to improve the
predictive ability.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4in,height=\textheight]{figures/cilia/cilia_AIC_deltaerror.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cilia_AIC_deltaerror}Comparing the change in
predictive accuracy using the augmented model (both population and
traits) as a response to the probability that the augmented model is
best for the ciliate system. Model accuracy was calculated using the
R-squared statistic.}

\end{figure}

In the ciliate system, the probability that the augmented model fitted
best was more beneficial when making predictions of population growth
than trait change (Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC_deltaerror}). In other
words, the cases in which the augmented model was substantially-better
fitting (e.g.~predictions of growth in \emph{Tetrahymena} 1, control)
yielded more accurate predictions of population growth than trait
changes.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4in,height=\textheight]{figures/cyano/cyano_AIC_deltaerror.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cyano_AIC_deltaerror}As
Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC_deltaerror} but for the cyanobacteria system.}

\end{figure}

In the cyanobacteria system, improvement in predictive accuracy by using
the augmented model was substantial only when the augmented model was
near-certain to be the best (Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_AIC_deltaerror}). The
augmented model improved predictions of trait change slightly more than
predictions of population growth.

We do not observe a consistent, cross-system result as to whether
population growth or trait changes are better-predicted by the augmented
model. The relationships are clearly environmentally-dependent and
system-specific, and variation in augmented model performance is
strongly dependent on environmental conditions. That said, for a large
number of the cyanobacteria microcosms, particularly in those without
atrazine added, the augmented model substantially outperforms the
single-variable model (Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_AIC_deltaerror}).

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec-DAE_discussion}

We have analysed population and trait dynamics in two microbial systems,
across various environmental conditions. Our results do not support a
general reciprocal relationship between both types of dynamics, but do
indicate that trait dynamics are better predicted when considering
population density for the cyanobacteria system, in particular.
Furthermore, trait effects on growth are dependent on the environment
(\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_td\_general}, \textbf{?@fig-cyano\_td\_general}):
a given trait value has differently effects on growth, depending on the
(a)biotic conditions (\citeproc{ref-Gibert2022}{Gibert et al. 2022};
\citeproc{ref-Wieczynski2021}{Wieczynski et al. 2021}).

Broadly-speaking, the population dynamics of the ciliate system across
most environmental conditions were better-described by simple
density-dependence, as used in most classical population models e.g.
Verhulst (\citeproc{ref-Verhulst1838}{1838}). Density-dependent growth
is clearly a driving force in these cases as their fitted model
coefficients were mostly significantly different from zero
(\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_td\_general}) and the augmented model was not
strongly supported on the basis of Akaike weights
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC}). Trait dynamics were similarly generally
better-described without including population density as a covariate
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_AIC}). While intrinsic trait dynamics are not as
well-founded as the equivalent methods in population dynamics
(i.e.~there are no real equivalents of trait intrinsic growth or
carrying capacity), this basic linear trait-dependent trait change still
generally outperformed the augmented model. Trait changes in the ciliate
system, then, seem unlikely to depend on the population density and,
according to these data, feedbacks between populations and traits in the
ciliate system are unlikely.

By contrast, in the cyanobacteria system, the augmented model
outperformed the population-only model in predicting population dynamics
more often than not and, in the cases where it did not fit well, the
population-only model was similarly poorly-fitting
(\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_R2}). Furthermore, trait dynamics in the
cyanobacteria system were much more consistently well-described by the
augmented model. Particularly in the atrazine-free treatments, where the
augmented model was near-certain to always be better, but even in the
combined atrazine and temperature (AT) treatments, its performance was
overall better. Overall, while population is only modestly
trait-dependent, the trait dynamics are clearly influenced by population
density. In certain cases, therefore, there is potential for feedbacks
between populations and traits (e.g.~strain V\_2524 in the control and
temperature treatments).

There are several possible explanations for the patterns observed.
Firstly, while we assess the linear relationships between traits and
growth rates, it is possible that nonlinear models could more accurately
predict the system dynamics. Nonlinear effects of traits on growth are
commonplace in natural systems (e.g.~the effects of body size on growth
are generally non-linear,
\citeproc{ref-Fernandez-Gonzalez2021}{FernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez and MaraÃ±Ã³n
2021}) and such specifics are lost in the simple model formulation here
although, for the most part, the linear models used seem appropriate
(\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_pcgr}, \textbf{?@fig-cilia\_dT},
\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_pcgr}, \textbf{?@fig-cyano\_dT}).

In a similar manner, the superior performance of the augmented model in
the cyanobacteria system compared to that of the ciliate system may be
due to differences in the traits measured. Firstly that, in the
cyanobacteria system, the aggregate trait summarised more of the trait
information present than in the ciliate system (\(79.5\%\) in the
cyanobacteria system against the \(53.6\%\) in the ciliate system,
Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_PC_var_explained} and
Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_PC_var_explained}). The ciliate traits were more
variable and demonstrated less congruent changes over time
(Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_pop_traits_time}). Secondly, it may be that the
cyanobacteria traits are more directly linked to growth than the ciliate
traits. For example, the concentration of photosynthetic pigments within
a cell controls absorption of incoming light and therefore growth.
Similarly, the effectiveness of light harvesting is likely
density-dependent (high cell densities cause shading, which can alter
pigmentation), which makes the pigmentation content subject to plastic
change in the time frame of our experiment
(\citeproc{ref-Stomp2004}{Stomp et al. 2004}). Pigmentation and size in
cyanobacteria both constitute resource uptake traits and may both
influence and depend on population growth
(\citeproc{ref-Maranon2015}{MaraÃ±Ã³n 2015};
\citeproc{ref-Stomp2007a}{Stomp et al. 2007}). In contrast, in the
ciliate system, only one trait, size, could be considered a direct
resource uptake trait. The other ciliate traits (movement linearity,
movement speed, and cell aspect ratio) are less-directly linked to
resource uptake rate and growth. To compute a more directly-functional
aggregate trait for the ciliate system may require a more specific
analysis, for example, by combining the movement and cell size traits
into a clearance rate, which may be more strongly-linked to the growth
of the heterotrophic ciliates (\citeproc{ref-Kiorboe1995}{KiÃ¸rboe and
Saiz 1995}; \citeproc{ref-Jacob2019}{Jacob et al. 2019}).

While we summarised the functional traits into a single aggregate trait
per strain and treatment, the individual traits monitored may have
distinct biological responses to the treatments applied and the changes
in population densities. Size changes in response to increased
temperatures is a well-documented phenomenon in microbes
(\citeproc{ref-Finkel2010}{Finkel et al. 2010}). \emph{Synechococcus}
may respond to atrazine exposure by entering a state of chlorosis,
characterised by a loss of chlorophyll and slower growth
(\citeproc{ref-Gonzalez-Barreiro2004}{GonzÃ¡lez-Barreiro et al. 2004}),
although this was not observed in the experimental populations presented
here (Figure~\ref{fig-cyano_pop_traits_time}). Ciliates are known to
adjust their motility and size in response to population density
(\citeproc{ref-Pennekamp2014}{Pennekamp et al. 2014};
\citeproc{ref-Gibert2022}{Gibert et al. 2022}), as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-cilia_pop_traits_time}.

While we have analysed growth curves and trait dynamics to infer
coupling between density and traits, akin to time series analysis, a
more direct approach would have consisted of a space-for-time approach.
In said approach, one experimentally crosses density and trait values,
and then monitors short-term growth and trait change (e.g.
\citeproc{ref-Wieczynski2021}{Wieczynski et al. 2021}). While
manipulating density is feasible, manipulating traits is less so. One
approach could be to grow cultures at different densities, which we know
will lead to different traits (\textbf{?@fig-cilia\_td\_general},
\textbf{?@fig-cyano\_td\_general}), and then create density gradients by
dilution. However, such space-for-time approaches do not guarantee a
reliable gradient of functional traits and are more experimentally
demanding.

We find that the potential for feedbacks is limited in our two
experimental systems across the environmental conditions considered.
However, in systems with multiple species present (i.e.~communities) the
potential for feedbacks grows considerably, as indirect interactions may
manifest across multiple species' densities and traits (e.g.
\citeproc{ref-Zelnik2022}{Zelnik et al. 2022}). However, one challenge
will be that the net result of such feedbacks at the level of population
and trait dynamics can be hard to identify, let alone be predicted.

The potential for mutations to take place during the course of the
experiments may differ between the two model systems due to their
population sizes and number of generations
(\citeproc{ref-Barrick2013}{\textbf{Barrick2013?}}). Assuming
approximate cell division rates of once per hour and once per day for
the ciliate and cyanobacteria systems, repectively,
(\citeproc{ref-DeLong2009}{\textbf{DeLong2009?}};
\citeproc{ref-Binder1995}{\textbf{Binder1995?}}) and accounting for
experiment length (\(\leq 30\) days and \(10\) days), average population
size (\(8.92 \times 10^{2}\) and \(2.38 \times 10^{4}\) cells), and
microcosm volumes (100 mL and 6 mL) gives the number of cell divisions
between \(9.6 \times 10^6\) and \(9.6 \times 10^8\) for the ciliate
system and \(6 \times 10^7\) and \(2.1 \times 10^{10}\) for the
cyanobacteria system. Therefore, we may expect that the cyanobacteria
system possessed greater potential for evolution during the course of
the experiment, as it is likely that more cell division events took
place. This increased likelihood of mutation events have resulted in
more prominent eco-evolutionary dynamics in the cyanobacteria system.

Alternative model-fitting approaches such as autoregressive models may
also be used to determine the co-dependence of populations and traits.
This may improve the analysis in some ways, e.g.~by allowing specific
error structures that depend on time. Generally, however, such models
require longer time series to be effective and are more of use when
forecasting time series than in understanding effects of state variables
on each other.

In conclusion, we found that the relationships between populations and
functional traits vary with model system and environmental context.
While reciprocal interactions between density and traits were apparent
for the cyanobacteria system, we did not find broad support for strong
feedbacks between population and trait change. More work is needed to
unveil the context dependence of growth-trait connections.
