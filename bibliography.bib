  abstract = {Microscopic marine phytoplankton drift freely in the ocean, harvesting sunlight through photosynthesis. These unicellular microorganisms account for half of the primary productivity on Earth and play pivotal roles in the biogeochemistry of our planet (Field et al., 1998). The major groups of microalgae that comprise the phytoplankton community are coccolithophores, diatoms and dinoflagellates. In present oceans, phytoplankton individuals and populations are forced to rapidly adjust, as key chemical and physical parameters defining marine habitats are changing globally. Here we propose that microalgal populations often display the characteristics of a multicellular-like community rather than a random collection of individuals. Evolution of multicellularity entails a continuum of events starting from single cells that go through aggregation or clonal divisions (Brunet and King, 2017). Phytoplankton may be an intermediate state between single cells and aggregates of physically attached cells that communicate and co-operate; perhaps an evolutionary snapshot toward multicellularity. In this opinion article, we journey through several studies conducted in two key phytoplankton groups, coccolithophores and diatoms, to demonstrate how observations in these studies could be interpreted in a multicellular context.},

We study how factors including the implementation and rate of dispersal, properties of the local environments, and the spatial topology of the metacommunity interact to determine the local and global diversity and the degree of synchronisation between local food webs. We investigate the influence of migration on the stability of local networks to perturbation, and simulate a 5 \texttimes{} 5 spatial arrangement of cells, demonstrating that combining adaptive migration and heterogeneous habitats allows distinct food webs to coevolve from the beginning of the simulation. When coupling food webs by diffusion migration after an initial period of isolation, the Webworld model can construct metacommunities of distinct food webs if the local sites have spatially-homogeneous environmental parameters. If the sites have heterogeneous parameters, synchronisation between food webs increases greatly, but this can be offset by a greater number of sites and less-connected spatial topologies.},

We analyse a dynamic model of these adaptive scenarios in which the rate of change of the mean trait value is an increasing function of the fitness gradient (i.e. the rate of increase of individual fitness with the individual's trait value). Such models have been employed in evolutionary game theory and are often appropriate both for the evolution of quantitative genetic traits and for the behavioural adjustment of phenotypically plastic traits. The dynamics of the adaptation of several different ecologically important traits can result in characters that minimize individual fitness and can preclude evolution towards characters that maximize individual fitness. We discuss biological circumstances that are likely to produce such adaptive failures for situations involving foraging, predator avoidance, competition and coevolution. The results argue for greater attention to dynamical stability in models of the evolution of continuous traits.},

However, survival in a multispecies community depends upon interactions, and some species may even be favored by a harsh environment that impairs others, leading to potentially surprising community transitions as environments deteriorate. Here we combine theory and laboratory microcosms to predict how simple microbial communities will change under added mortality, controlled by varying dilution. We find that in a two-species coculture, increasing mortality favors the faster grower, confirming a theoretical prediction. Furthermore, if the slower grower dominates under low mortality, the outcome can reverse as mortality increases. We find that this tradeoff between growth and competitive ability is prevalent at low dilution, causing outcomes to shift dramatically as dilution increases, and that these two-species shifts propagate to simple multispecies communities. Our results argue that a bottom-up approach can provide insight into how communities change under stress.},

Location: Atlantic Ocean and Global Ocean Methods: Using phytoplankton size composition data, nutrient concentrations (nitrite+nitrate, phosphate, and silicate), irradiance, temperature and zooplankton abundances of the Atlantic Meridional Transect programme, we derived and tested an environmental classification method of phytoplankton size distribution with a k-means clustering technique. We then used principal component and Dirichlet multivariate regression analyses to disentangle the relative influence of different environmental conditions on the phytoplankton size composition. Subsequently, we evaluated different probabilisitic models and selected the most parsimonious one to estimate the global phytoplankton size distributions in the world oceans based on global climatology data of the World Ocean Atlas 2009. Results: Based only on prevailing environmental conditions and without a priori knowledge concerning, for example, the position of oceanic fronts, the primary productivity, the distribution of organisms or any geographical information, our classification method captures the size structures of phytoplankton communities across the Atlantic. We find a strong influence of temperature and nitrite+nitrate concentration on the prevalence of the different size classes, and we present evidence that both factors may act independently on structuring phytoplankton communities. While at low nitrite+nitrate concentrations temperature has a major structuring impact, at high nitrite+nitrate concentrations its influence is reduced. Finally, we show that the global distribution of phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted by a probabilistic model based only on temperature and nitrite+nitrate. Main conclusion: The global distribution of phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted with good approximation using a parsimonious probabilistic model forced by only temperature and nitrite+nitrate data. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific variation in territory size and shape can have strong effects on population structure and dynamics. The traditional theoretical approach to the study of territory size is based on optimality models that analyze decisions of focal residents as responses to the costs and benefits of defense. These models have stimulated numerous empirical studies showing that territory holders adjust their behavior according to rates of intrusion and availability of food. However, models of optimal territory size are applicable only in limited circumstances because they focus on unilateral decisions rather than on interactions. Furthermore, observational and experimental studies often find that territory sizes are insensitive to food supply. Recently, greater emphasis has been placed on two alternative approaches. The first concerns interactions among contiguous neighbors and how these affect use of space. In these models territory size and shape are determined by the balance of pressure exerted at boundaries or arise as the results of local rules of movement and interaction. The second alternative approach views territory size as the outcome of interactions between established residents and potential settlers attempting to acquire territories. By considering the simultaneous actions of multiple competitors, these models allow quantitative prediction of the effects of territory defense on population density and spatial patterns as well as responses to environmental change.},

In the case of associational resistance, habitat is modified to ameliorate stress, benefitting other organisms. The SGH is contentious due to conflicting evidence and theoretical perspectives, so we adopted a meta-analytic approach to determine if it is widely supported across a variety of contexts, including different kingdoms, ecosystems, habitats, interactions, stressors, and life history stages. We developed an extensive list of Boolean search criteria to search the published ecological literature and successfully detect studies that both directly tested the hypothesis, and those that were relevant but never mentioned it. We found that the SGH is well supported by studies that feature bacteria, plants, terrestrial ecosystems, interspecific negative interactions, adults, survival instead of growth or reproduction, and drought, fire, and nutrient stress. We conclude that the SGH is indeed a broadly relevant ecological hypothesis that is currently held back by cross-disciplinary communication barriers. More SGH research is needed beyond the scope of interspecific plant competition, and more SGH research should feature multifactor stress. There remains a need to account for positive interactions in scientific pursuits, such as associational resistance in tests of the SGH.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

  abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes, choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions, 2) their past-present-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is, however, rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution), the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales, and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected, the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However, model quality depends not only on the algorithm, but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used. Although model fit was higher for the consensus approach and Maxent, Maxent and GAM models were more consistent in estimating local occurrence, while RF and GBM showed higher consistency in environmental variables selection. Model outcomes diverged more for narrowly distributed species than for widespread species. We suggest that matching study aims with modelling approach is essential in Species Distribution Models, and provide suggestions how to do this for different modelling aims and species' data characteristics (i.e. sample size, spatial distribution). \textcopyright{} 2013 Aguirre-Guti\'errez et al.},

Here we sequenced multiple gene loci from cultured strains to confirm the congruency of clade classifications between the 16S-23S rDNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS), 16S rDNA, narB, ntcA, and rpoC1 loci commonly used in Synechococcus diversity studies. We designed quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that target the ITS for 10 Synechococcus clades, including four clades, XV, XVI, CRD1, and CRD2, not covered by previous assays employing other loci. Our new qPCR assays are very sensitive and specific, detecting down to tens of cells per ml. Application of these qPCR assays to field samples from the northwest Atlantic showed clear shifts in Synechococcus community composition across a coastal to open-ocean transect. Consistent with previous studies, clades I and IV dominated cold, coastal Synechococcus communities. Clades II and X were abundant at the two warmer, off-shore stations, and at all stations multiple Synechococcus clades co-occurred. qPCR assays developed here provide valuable tools to further explore the dynamics of microbial community structure and the mechanisms of co-existence.},

The governmental interest for participating in such as an initiative is based upon current national needs for broad-scale information to help the implementation of national and international obligations. These include implementation of EU directives (e.g. EC Habi- tats Directive, the EU Water Framework Directive and the proposed EU Marine Strat- egy Directive) or for finding transnational solutions to initiatives such as the Baltic Sea Action Plan undertaken by the Helsinki Convention.

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

  abstract = {Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic.4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2010 British Ecological Society.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems provide irreplaceable services for both nature and society. The quality and quantity of freshwater affect biogeochemical processes and ecological dynamics that determine biodiversity, ecosystem productivity, and human health and welfare at local, regional and global scales. Freshwater ecosystems and their associated riparian habitats are amongst the most biologically diverse on Earth, and have inestimable economic, health, cultural, scientific and educational values. Yet human impacts to lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and groundwater are dramatically reducing biodiversity and robbing critical natural resources and services from current and future generations. Freshwater biodiversity is declining rapidly on every continent and in every major river basin on Earth, and this degradation is occurring more rapidly than in terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, about one third of all global freshwater discharges pass through human agricultural, industrial or urban infrastructure. About one fifth of the Earth's arable land is now already equipped for irrigation, including all the most productive lands, and this proportion is projected to surpass one third by midcentury to feed the rapidly expanding populations of humans and commensal species, especially poultry and ruminant livestock. Less than one fifth of the world's preindustrial freshwater wetlands remain, and this proportion is projected to decline to under one tenth by midcentury, with imminent threats from water transfer megaprojects in Brazil and India, and coastal wetland drainage megaprojects in China. The Living Planet Index for freshwater vertebrate populations has declined to just one third that of 1970, and is projected to sink below one fifth by midcentury. A linear model of global economic expansion yields the chilling prediction that human utilization of critical freshwater resources will approach one half of the Earth's total capacity by midcentury. Although the magnitude and growth of the human freshwater footprint are greater than is generally understood by policy makers, the news media, or the general public, slowing and reversing dramatic losses of freshwater species and ecosystems is still possible. We recommend a set of urgent policy actions that promote clean water, conserve watershed services, and restore freshwater ecosystems and their vital services. Effective management of freshwater resources and ecosystems must be ranked amongst humanity's highest priorities.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. A method is described for the simultaneous treatment of 42 (or more) stocks of Paramecium, and their adaptation to growth in axenic culture. Samples of dense cultures of these ciliates growing with Enterobacter aerogenes are rendered bacteria-free by migration through 2 sets of tubes containing Adaptation Medium (Peters' salts solution, stigmasterol, vitamins, and autoclaved E. aerogenes). The 2nd set of tubes contains Adaptation Medium plus antibiotics. Bacteria-free samples containing {$\sim$} 100 animals are then transferred to test tubes containing Adaptation Medium without antibiotics. This medium also serves as a growth medium. It supports indefinite growth of all Paramecium stocks tested. After adaptation to this medium, the ciliates can be grown in the axenic medium developed by Soldo, Godoy \& van Wagtendonk. On a single trial at least half of the stocks can be expected to produce axenic cultures within 5 to 10 days by these procedures. The method has been applied successfully to several of the species of the Paramecium aurelia complex, to all syngens of Paramecium multimicronucleatum, to several stocks of Paramecium jenningsi, and to 1 stock each of Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium calkinsi. A modification of the method also works for Didinium nasutum. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {Recent theory, such as the insurance hypothesis, suggests that higher species diversity may dampen perturbation dynamics within a community. The dynamics of a rocky intertidal macroalgal community were evaluated using an experimentally induced heat stress applied at the end of a 15-mo manipulation of diversity. This pulse event produced a gradient of thermal stress within plots and, consequently, different degrees of perturbation. In general, the resistance of the community to the thermal stress was forecast by the pre-stress cover of dominant species, total algal cover, and standing biomass. Because higher diversity treatments, especially those containing the dominant algal group, fucoids, had higher overall abundance, highest diversity treatments were the most severely affected. The stress was also relatively nonselective, in that species were reduced in roughly equivalent proportions, suggesting an important distinction for predicting when diversity will not influence disturbance dynamics. The resilience of the community was strongly dependent on which species were initially present in the plots and the degree of disturbance. In highly disturbed areas, although the recovery trajectory was similar in early successional stages, differences emerged later; these differences appear to be attributable to the composition of the surrounding regeneration pool. For treatments not receiving the thermal stress, low-diversity plots without fucoids remained in states unlike the reference condition for most of the monitored resilience period. But plots in high-diversity treatments, even areas within plots that had experienced moderate disturbance, returned to states similar to the reference quickly. Thus, resilience (but not resistance) results are consistent with the insurance hypothesis. Overall, diversity's influence on community dynamics is complex and will depend on the characteristics of the stress as well as the characteristics of the species present in the community. \textcopyright{} 2004 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences. Synergistic effects of habitat destruction, overfishing, introduced species, warming, acidification, toxins, and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms, transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones, and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified, microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms, jellyfish, and disease. Rates of change are increasingly fast and nonlinear with sudden phase shifts to novel alternative community states. We can only guess at the kinds of organisms that will benefit from this mayhem that is radically altering the selective seascape far beyond the consequences of fishing or warming alone. The prospects are especially bleak for animals and plants compared with metabolically flexible microbes and algae. Halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries, agricultural practice, and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Species trait data have been used to predict and infer ecological processes and the responses of biological communities to environmental changes. It has also been suggested that, in lieu of trait, data niche differences can be inferred from phylogenetic distance. It remains unclear how variation in trait data may influence the strength and character of ecological inference. Using species-level trait data in community ecology assumes intraspecific variation is small in comparison with interspecific variation. Intraspecific variation across species ranges or within populations may lead to variability in trait data derived from different scales (i.e., local or regional) and methods (i.e., mean or maximum values). Variation in trait data across species can affect community-level relationships. I examined variability in body size, a key trait often measured across taxa. I collected 12 metrics of fish species length (including common and maximum values) for 40 species from literature, online databases, museum collections, and field data. I then tested whether different metrics of fish length could consistently predict observed species range boundary shifts and the impacts of an introduced predator on inland lake fish communities across Ontario, Canada. I also investigated whether phylogenetic signal, an indicator of niche-conservativism, changed among measures. I found strong correlations between length metrics and limited variation across metrics. Accordingly, length was a consistently significant predictor of the response of fish communities to environmental change. Additionally, I found significant evidence of phylogenetic signal in fish length across metrics. Limited variation in length across metrics (within species), in comparison with variation within metrics (across species), made fish species length a reliable predictor at a community-level. When considering species-level trait data from different sources, researchers should examine the potential influence of intraspecific trait variation on data derived by different metrics and at different scales. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Author.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been shown to increase long-term temporal stability of fish communities and enhance ecosystem resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, the potential ability of MPAs to buffer effects of environmental variability at shorter time scales remains widely unknown. In the tropics, the yearly monsoon cycle is a major natural force affecting marine organisms in tropical regions, and its timing and severity are predicted to change over the coming century, with potentially severe effects on marine organisms, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here, we assessed the ability of MPAs to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on seagrass-associated fish communities, using a field survey in two MPAs (no-take zones) and two unprotected (open-access) sites around Zanzibar (Tanzania). We assessed the temporal stability of fish density and community structure within and outside MPAs during three monsoon seasons in 2014\textendash 2015, and investigated several possible mechanisms that could regulate temporal stability. Our results show that MPAs did not affect fish density and diversity, but that juvenile fish densities were temporally more stable within MPAs. Second, fish community structure was more stable within MPAs for juvenile and adult fish, but not for subadult fish or the total fish community. Third, the observed effects may be due to a combination of direct and indirect (seagrass-mediated) effects of seasonality and, potentially, fluctuating fishing pressure outside MPAs. In summary, these MPAs may not have the ability to enhance fish density and diversity and to buffer effects of monso on seasonality on the whole fish community. However, they may increase the temporal stability of certain groups, such as juvenile fish. Consequently, our results question whether MPAs play a general role in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning under changing environmental conditions in tropical seagrass fish communities.},

However, we know little about the direct and indirect effects of ocean acidification and also how these effects interact with other features of environmental change such as warming and declining consumer pressure. In this study, we tested whether the presence of consumers (invertebrate mesograzers) influenced the interactive effects of ocean acidification andwarming on benthic microalgae in a seagrass community mesocosm experiment. Net effects of acidification andwarming on benthicmicroalgal biomass and production, as assessed by analysis of variance, were relativelyweak regardless of grazer presence. However, partitioning these net effects into direct and indirect effects using structural equation modeling revealed several strong relationships. In the absence of grazers, benthic microalgae were negatively and indirectly affected by sediment-associated microalgal grazers and macroalgal shading, but directly and positively affected by acidification and warming. Combining indirect and direct effects yielded no or weak net effects. In the presence of grazers, almost all direct and indirect climate effects were nonsignificant. Our analyses highlight that (i) indirect effects of climate change may be at least as strong as direct effects, (ii) grazers are crucial in mediating these effects, and (iii) effects of ocean acidification may be apparent only through indirect effects and in combination with other variables (e. g.,warming). These findings highlight the importance of experimental designs and statistical analyses that allow us to separate and quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple climate variables on natural communities.},

Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 1999, 37, 164), were investigated for the underlying joint effect. Components identified in an organic sediment extract included several PAHs (benzo[ghi]fluoranthene, benz[a]anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, 2-phenylnaphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) plus prometryn, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and parathion-methyl. Experiments were performed using a one-generation algal bioassay with the unicellular green algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus as well as chlorophyll fluorescence quenching analysis to describe the effects of the components and mixtures thereof. Analysis of the mixture effects based on concentration-response modeling of the effect data reveals that indeed effect contributions of several components can be expected although the mixture ratio is not equitoxic and the individual components vary greatly with respect to biological effect. Comparing predicted and observed mixture effects, the combined effect may not be attributed to a joint narcotic effect of the mixture components. Evidently, some of the components act specifically and dissimilar and may therefore be best described in their combined effect by response addition while for others a similar mode of action seems plausible. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching analysis supports to discriminate between prometryn, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and PAHs. A joint model for calculating the combined effect using concentration addition for the suspected unspecifically acting components in algae (PAHs and parathion-methyl) and subsequently response addition for this group and the other components clearly improves the description of the observed combined effect. Allocation of effect contributions to specific components using toxic units or effect contributions lead to different judgments. The observed combined effect of a 3-compound mixture of prometryn, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and benzo[ghi]fluoranthene is indistinguishable from the effects of the original 10-compound mixture, demonstrating the need in site-specific assessment of complex contamination to account for the mode of action of contaminants. Implications forthe confirmation step in effect-directed analysis of substances causing effects in complex contaminated samples are discussed.},

  abstract = {Environmental quality monitoring of water resources is challenged with providing the basis for safeguarding the environment against adverse biological effects of anthropogenic chemical contamination from diffuse and point sources. While current regulatory efforts focus on monitoring and assessing a few legacy chemicals, many more anthropogenic chemicals can be detected simultaneously in our aquatic resources. However, exposure to chemical mixtures does not necessarily translate into adverse biological effects nor clearly shows whether mitigation measures are needed. Thus, the question which mixtures are present and which have associated combined effects becomes central for defining adequate monitoring and assessment strategies. Here we describe the vision of the international, EU-funded project SOLUTIONS, where three routes are explored to link the occurrence of chemical mixtures at specific sites to the assessment of adverse biological combination effects. First of all, multi-residue target and non-target screening techniques covering a broader range of anticipated chemicals co-occurring in the environment are being developed. By improving sensitivity and detection limits for known bioactive compounds of concern, new analytical chemistry data for multiple components can be obtained and used to characterise priority mixtures. This information on chemical occurrence will be used to predict mixture toxicity and to derive combined effect estimates suitable for advancing environmental quality standards. Secondly, bioanalytical tools will be explored to provide aggregate bioactivity measures integrating all components that produce common (adverse) outcomes even for mixtures of varying compositions. The ambition is to provide comprehensive arrays of effect-based tools and trait-based field observations that link multiple chemical exposures to various environmental protection goals more directly and to provide improved in situ observations for impact assessment of mixtures. Thirdly, effect-directed analysis (EDA) will be applied to identify major drivers of mixture toxicity. Refinements of EDA include the use of statistical approaches with monitoring information for guidance of experimental EDA studies. These three approaches will be explored using case studies at the Danube and Rhine river basins as well as rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The synthesis of findings will be organised to provide guidance for future solution-oriented environmental monitoring and explore more systematic ways to assess mixture exposures and combination effects in future water quality monitoring.},

  abstract = {1.Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have a long tradition and are widely used to investigate general concepts in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology. Many variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of biological organization. This includes measurements of body size, mobility, or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics, dispersal behaviour, and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. 2.Past studies, however, have used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow-cytometry, image and video analyses, and in-situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution. 3.Here, we take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance, measurement, and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a community updateable online repository. 4.We envision that such a synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and challenges faced by past studies, and also promote activities such as meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously across many different laboratories at a global scale.

Natural and anthropogenic stressors often interact, complicating general predictions. In this study, we examined the interactive and cumulative effects of two common environmental stressors, lowered calcium concentration, an anthropogenic stressor, and predator presence, a natural stressor, on the water flea Daphnia pulex. We analyzed expression changes of five genes involved in calcium homeostasis-cuticle proteins (Cutie, Icp2), calbindin (Calb), and calcium pump and channel (Serca and Ip3R)-using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in a full factorial experiment. We observed strong synergistic interactions between low calcium concentration and predator presence. While the Ip3R gene was not affected by the stressors, the other four genes were affected in their transcriptional levels by the combination of the stressors. Transcriptional patterns of genes that code for cuticle proteins (Cutie and Icp2) and a sarcoplasmic calcium pump (Serca) only responded to the combination of stressors, changing their relative expression levels in a synergistic response, while a calcium-binding protein (Calb) responded to low calcium stress and the combination of both stressors. The expression pattern of these genes (Cutie, Icp2, and Serca) were nonlinear, yet they were dose dependent across the calcium gradient. Multiple stressors can have complex, often unexpected effects on ecosystems. This study demonstrates that the dominant interaction for the set of tested genes appears to be synergism. We argue that gene expression patterns can be used to understand and predict the type of interaction expected when organisms are exposed simultaneously to natural and anthropogenic stressors.},

Understanding the structuring of phenotypic diversity in response to local environmental pressures can provide important insights into species evolutionary dynamics and responses to environmental change. This work examines the influence of steep environmental gradients on intraspecific phenotypic variation and tests two hypotheses about how the tropical soft grass mouse, Akodon mollis (Cricetidae, Rodentia), contends with the disparate environmental conditions encompassed by its broad distribution. Specifically, we test if the species expresses a geographically unstructured, or generalist, phenotype throughout its range or if it shows geographically localized morphological differentiation across disparate environments. Results: Using geometric morphometric and ecomorphological analyses of skull shape variation we found that despite distinct environmental conditions, geographically structured morphological variation is limited, with the notable exception of a distinct morphological disjunction at the high-elevation forest-grassland transition in the southern portion of A. mollis distribution. Based on genetic analyses, geographic isolation alone does not explain this localized phenotype, given that similar levels of genetic differentiation were also observed among individuals inhabiting other ecosystems that are nonetheless not distinct morphologically. Conclusions: Instead of phenotypic specialization across environments in these tropical mountains, there was limited differentiation of skull shape and size across the broad range of A. mollis, with the exception of individuals from the puna, the highest-elevation ecosystem. The high morphological variance among individuals, together with a weak association with local environmental conditions, not only highlights the flexibility of A. mollis' skull, but also highlights the need for further study to understand what maintains the observed morphological patterns. The work also indicates that mechanisms other than processes linked to local ecological specialization as a driver of diversification may contribute to the high diversity of this tropical region. \textcopyright{} 2013 Alvarado-Serrano et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Natural populations of planktonic Synechococcus spp. exhibit diel variations in abundance and frequency of dividing cells (FDC) during the warm seasons ({$>$}25\textdegree C) in coastal water of the western subtropical Pacific ocean. We hypothesized that differences in grazing rates during the day/dark cycle were a major cause of the observed diel variations in Synechococcus spp. abundance. We used fluores-cently labeled particles (FLP) as tracers of feeding on Synechococcus spp. in June and August 2007. Our results showed that FDC of Synechococcus spp. were highest at dusk (50\%) and lowest ({$<$}10\%) between midnight and early morning. Synechococcus spp. had three abundance phases, accrual (I), peak (II), and diminished (III). Moreover, FDC values gradually increased in phase I, declined to the lowest values during phase II, and remained at low levels throughout phase III. Our results strongly indicated that pigmented nanoflagellate (PNF) grazing was the underlying biological factor regulating diel variations in Synecho-coccus spp. abundance. And, the rate of PNF ingestion peaked during the night on smaller non-dividing cells following a peak of Synechococcus spp. abundance in phase II. These findings provide evidence that diel variations in ingestion rates are affected by non-dividing cells of Synechococcus spp. and imply that the impacts of PNF grazing on Synechococcus spp. is based on food selectivity by size.},

Yet, most protists in the photic zone engage in some degree of phagotrophy, and it has been suggested that trophic strategy is really a continuum between pure phototrophs (phytoplankton) and pure phagotrophs (unicellular zooplankton). Such a continuum of trophic strategies is well represented by trait-based modelling techniques. A key model ingredient is the size of individual cells, as size constrains affinities for nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and active encounter with other cells. We outline a general trait-based model of a unicellular planktonic organism where size is a central trait and where nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and phagotrophy are determined by investments into these functions and by the physical constraints imposed by organism size. This framework provides simple predictions of how trophic strategy correlates with size.},

Here, we examine how changes in the extent of the study region (ignored or under-appreciated in most studies) affect models of two rodents, Nephelomys caracolus and Nephelomys meridensis. Location North-central South America. Methods We used Maxent to model the species' potential distributions via two methods of defining the study region. In Method 1 (typical of most studies to date), we calibrated the model in a large study region that included the ranges of both species. In Method 2, we calibrated the model using a smaller study region surrounding the localities of the focal species, and then applied it to the larger region. Because the study region of Method 1 is likely to include areas of suitable conditions that are unoccupied because of dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions, this approach is prone to overfitting to conditions found near the occupied localities. In contrast, Method 2 should avoid such problems but may require further assumptions (`clamping' in Maxent) to make predictions for areas with environmental conditions beyond those found in the smaller study region. For each method, we calculated several measures of geographic interpredictivity between predictions for the species (cross-species AUC, cross-species omission rate, and proportional geographic overlap). Results Compared with Method 1, Method 2 revealed a larger predicted area for each species, less concentrated around known localities (especially for N. caracolus). It also led to higher cross-species AUC values, lower cross-species omission rates and higher proportions of geographic overlap. Clamping was minimal and occurred primarily in regions unlikely to be suitable. Main conclusions Method 2 led to more realistic predictions and higher estimates of niche conservatism. Conclusions reached by many studies depend on the selection of an appropriate study region. Although detailed information regarding dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions will typically be difficult to obtain, consideration of coarse distributional patterns, topography and vegetational zones often should permit delimitation of a much more reasonable study region than the extremely large ones currently in common use.},

However, models projecting phenotypic responses to future climate change typically assume populations will respond similarly across the range of a species, while local adaptation and spatial variation in environmental changes are rarely considered. In this study, among-population phenotypic variability was coupled with geographic variation in anticipated hydrologic changes to examine patterns of population-level phenotypic changes expected under future climatic change. To estimate phenotypic responses to watershed hydrology, phenotype-environment associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow were quantified among populations of six species of fishes (Cyprinidae). Future streamflow estimates (2070\textendash 2099) were then used to project body shapes within populations, assuming the same phenotype-environment relationships. All species exhibited significant associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow discharge and variability. However, these relationships were not consistent, even among species occupying similar vertical positions in the water column. When these phenotype-environment relationships were projected into future streamflow conditions, populations are not expected to respond uniformly across the species' ranges, and all but one species exhibited projected morphologies outside of the current range of morphological variation. These findings suggest local adaptation and spatial heterogeneity in environmental changes interact to influence variation in the degree of expected phenotypic responses to climate change at both the species and population level. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

M. aeruginosa is a unicellular cyanobacteria that form colonies. They produce toxins and therefore become a potential threat to water quality and human health. Understanding the distribution of this species in space and time is important for improving water management strategies. The model we propose includes both hydrodynamics and physiological responses including explicitly buoyancy regulation in Microcystis cells. Our model applies the Langevin-Fokker-Planck approach to simulate the total colony number concentration along the water column. This approach allows the description of sinking and rising velocities of colonies of different sizes and compositions subjected to turbulent mixing. The model is first applied to the 30. m deep Lake Vlietland in the Netherlands for the summer of 2009. During this summer, the lake showed high blooms of Microcystis which eventually led to scum formation along the shore. The simulations show the preferential distribution of M. aeruginosa through the water column and their strong dependency on colony size. On a daily cycle, small colonies (50-200 ??m) do not remain near the surface but are highly concentrated in the middle of the epilimnion, whereas large colonies (???800 ??m) are able to migrate to greater depths and concentrate only temporarily near the surface. For comparing our computer model with available measurements of Microcystis concentration distributions we applied it to Lakes IJsselmeer and Vinkeveen. The results show a good agreement with the observations of diurnal changes in buoyancy status. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

One aspect of predator-prey interactions for which little is known are the mechanisms by which Synechococcus avoids or resists predation and, in turn, how this relates to the ability of Synechococcus to support growth of protist grazer populations. Grazing experiments conducted with the raptorial dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina and phylogenetically diverse Synechococcus isolates (strains WH8102, CC9605, CC9311, and CC9902) revealed marked differences in grazing rates\textemdash specifically that WH8102 was grazed at significantly lower rates than all other isolates. Additional experiments using the heterotrophic nanoflagellate Goniomonas pacifica and the filter-feeding tintinnid ciliate Eutintinnis sp. revealed that this pattern in grazing susceptibility among the isolates transcended feeding guilds and grazer taxon. Synechococcus cell size, elemental ratios, and motility were not able to explain differences in grazing rates, indicating that other features play a primary role in grazing resistance. Growth of heterotrophic protists was poorly coupled to prey ingestion and was influenced by the strain of Synechococcus being consumed. Although Synechococcus was generally a poor-quality food source, it tended to support higher growth and survival of G. pacifica and O. marina relative to Eutintinnis sp., indicating that suitability of Synechococcus varies among grazer taxa and may be a more suitable food source for the smaller protist grazers. This work has developed tractable model systems for further studies of grazer- Synechococcus interactions in marine microbial food webs.},

Adaptiveness to local conditions could change at different sites in the future. In this context, the study of intra-specific variability is important to clarify the singularity of different local populations. Phenotypic differentiation between three beech provenances covering a wide latitudinal range (Spain/ES, Germany/DE and Sweden/SE), was studied in a greenhouse experiment. Non-target leaf metabolite profiles and ecophysiological response was analyzed in well-watered and water stressed seedlings. There was a provenance-specific pattern in the relative concentrations of some leaf metabolites regardless watering treatment. The DE and SE from the center and north of the distribution area of the species showed a clear differentiation from the ES provenance in the relative concentration of some metabolites. Thus the ES provenance from the south maintained larger relative concentration of some organic and amino acids (e.g. fumaric and succinic acids or valine and isoleucine), and in some secondary metabolites (e.g. kaempferol, caffeic and ferulic acids). The ecophysiological response to mild water stress was similar among the three provenances as a consequence of the moderate water stress applied to seedlings, although leaf N isotope composition ({$\delta$} 15 N) and leaf C:N ratio were higher and lower respectively in DE than in the other two provenances. This would suggest potential differences in the capacity to uptake and post-process nitrogen according to provenance. An important focus of the study was to address for the first time inter-provenance leaf metabolic diversity in beech from a non-targeted metabolic profiling approach that allowed differentiation of the three studied provenances. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Phytoplankton production and chlorophyll a (chl a) biomass were measured at 7 optical depths, including the depth of subsurface chl a maximum (Z(SCM)). Phytoplankton taxonomy, abundance, and size structure were determined at the ZSCM. Redundancy analyses and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to assess relationships between phytoplankton composition in relation to biological and environmental variables. In late summer/fall, the CHA was characterized by (1) an oligotrophic flagellate-based system extending over the eastern Beaufort Sea, the peripheral Amundsen Gulf, and the central region of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago; and (2) a eutrophic diatom-based system located in Baffin Bay, Lancaster Sound, and in a hotspot in the central Amundsen Gulf. The oligotrophic regions were characterized by low production and biomass of large phytoplankton cells (\textquestiondown{} 5 mu m) and relatively high abundance of eukaryotic picophytoplankton (\textexclamdown{} 2 mu m) and unidentified nanoflagellates (2-20 mu m). The eutrophic regions were characterized by high production and biomass of large cells and relatively high abundance of centric diatoms, mainly Chaetoceros spp. The distinction between the 2 regimes was explained by differences in stratification (density gradient) and nitrate concentrations at the Z(SCM). This study demonstrates the key role of vertical mixing and nutrient input in shaping the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the CHA, showing how ongoing environmental changes have the capacity to alter the diversity of biogeographic regions in the CHA.},

However, the empirical food webs that have been investigated for their structural properties represent local communities that are only a subset of a larger pool of regionally coexisting species. Here, we use a simple model to investigate the effects of regional food web structure on local food webs that are assembled by two simple processes: random immigration of species from a source web (regional food web), and random extinction of species within the local web. The model shows that local webs with non-random degree distributions can arise from randomly structured source webs. A comparison of local webs assembled from randomly structured source webs with local webs assembled from source webs generated by the niche model shows that the former have higher species richness at equilibrium, but have a nonlinear response to changing extinction rates. These results imply that the network structure of regional food webs can play a significant role in the assembly and dynamics of local webs in natural ecosystems. With natural landscapes becoming increasingly fragmented, understanding such structure may be a necessary key to understanding the maintenance and stability of local species diversity. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

It is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited from conceptual advances made in microclimatology and boundary-layer climatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic source areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by the roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of cities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending on the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The review focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses advances in the study of selected urban climatic processes relating to urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and exchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration ranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through streets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the literature on the urban temperature field. The state of knowledge about urban heat islands around 1980 is described and work since then is assessed in terms of similarities to and contrasts with that situation. Finally, the main advances are summarized and recommendations for urban climate work in the future are made. \textcopyright{} 2003 Royal Meteorological Society.},

A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity: the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often quantified as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and reflecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity. Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic, stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively defined as the inverse of the strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including realistic models of environmental fluctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures between resilience and reactivity and that, although defined with respect to persistent perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

  abstract = {Quantifying stability properties of ecosystems is an important problem in ecology. A common approach is based on the recovery from pulse perturbations, and posits that the faster an ecosystem return to its pre-perturbation state, the more stable it is. Theoretical studies often collapse the recovery dynamics into a single quantity: the long-term rate of return, called asymptotic resilience. However, empirical studies typically measure the recovery dynamics at much shorter time scales. In this paper we explain why asymptotic resilience is rarely representative of the short-term recovery. First, we show that, in contrast to asymptotic resilience, short-term return rates depend on features of the perturbation, in particular on the way its intensity is distributed over species. We argue that empirically relevant predictions can be obtained by considering the median response over a set of perturbations, for which we provide explicit formulas. Next, we show that the recovery dynamics are controlled through time by different species: abundant species tend to govern the short-term recovery, while rare species often dominate the long-term recovery. This shift from abundant to rare species typically causes short-term return rates to be unrelated to asymptotic resilience. We illustrate that asymptotic resilience can be determined by rare species that have almost no effect on the observable part of the recovery dynamics. Finally, we discuss how these findings can help to better connect empirical observations and theoretical predictions.},

This requires that we abandon one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values generated by all possible stochastic perturbations. Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity\textendash stability patterns. We conclude that a multidimensional perspective on variability helps reveal the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

  abstract = {Ecological systems can show complex and sometimes abrupt responses to environmental change, with important implications for their resilience. Theories of alternate stable states have been used to predict regime shifts of ecosystems as equilibrium responses to sufficiently slow environmental change. The actual rate of environmental change is a key factor affecting the response, yet we are still lacking a non-equilibrium theory that explicitly considers the influence of this rate of environmental change. We present a metacommunity model of predator-prey interactions displaying multiple stable states, and we impose an explicit rate of environmental change in habitat quality (carrying capacity) and connectivity (dispersal rate). We study how regime shifts depend on the rate of environmental change and compare the outcome with a stability analysis in the corresponding constant environment. Our results reveal that in a changing environment, the community can track states that are unstable in the constant environment. This tracking can lead to regime shifts, including local extinctions, that are not predicted by alternative stable state theory. In our metacommunity, tracking unstable states also controls the maintenance of spatial heterogeneity and spatial synchrony. Tracking unstable states can also lead to regime shifts that may be reversible or irreversible. Our study extends current regime shift theories to integrate rate-dependent responses to environmental change. It reveals the key role of unstable states for predicting transient dynamics and long-term resilience of ecological systems to climate change. This article is protected by copyright.

Nonetheless, very few studies have explicitly quantified genotype plasticity-productivity relationships in agriculture or forestry. Here, we conceptualize the importance of intraspecific variation in agricultural and forest species plasticity, and discuss the physiological and genetic factors contributing to intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity. Our discussion highlights the need for an integrated understanding of the mechanisms of G\texttimes E, more extensive assessments of genotypic responses to climate change under field conditions, and explicit testing of genotype plasticity-productivity relationships. Ultimately, further investigation of intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity in agriculture and forestry may prove important for identifying genotypes capable of increasing or sustaining productivity under more extreme climatic conditions. \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

In our earlier method, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was measured by first reducing it to GSH with glutathione reductase (GR) in the presence of NADPH. However, this is a very costly and time-consuming technique. The method described here employs a common and inexpensive thiol-disulfide exchanging agent, DTT, for reduction of GSSG to GSH, followed by derivatization with NPM.

PA models are able to account for the scale-free degree distributions observed in many real-world large networks by sequentially introducing nodes that attach preferentially to existing nodes with high degree. The ability to efficiently generate instances from PA models is a key asset in understanding both the models themselves and the real networks that they represent. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the problem of efficient instance generation. In this paper, we show that the complexity of generating network instances from a PA model depends on the preference function of the model, provides efficient data structures that work under any preference function, and presents empirical results from an implementation based on these data structures. We demonstrate that, by indexing growing networks with a simple augmented heap, we can implement a network generator which scales many orders of magnitude beyond existing capabilities (106 to 108 nodes). We show the utility of an efficient and general PA network generator by investigating the consequences of varying the preference functions of an existing model. We also provide `quicknet,' a freely available open-source implementation of the methods described in this work.},

Forests are cleared and oleasters (wild olive trees) are preserved by farmers for their valuable oil and for use as rootstocks to graft olive. This practice is among those that have shaped olive domestication in the Mediterranean region. It contributes to the creation of forest-based olive agroecosystems and favors olive intraspecific diversity that is highly adapted to heterogeneous mountain environments. Productions contribute to food security, short trade circuits, land tenure and cultural identity. Ethnobiological studies show a continuity of classification, naming and uses between selected oleaster types and olive varieties suggesting an ongoing domestication process. This is supported by genetic analyses which show a higher concentration of genotypes selected from seedlings that propagate through sexual propagation in OOAs as compared to areas where management of oleasters for oil and as rootstocks is absent. Photointerpretation of aerial images corroborated with field-based observations, show the impacts of exogenous projects since the French and Spanish Protectorate periods to contemporary projects of the state policy ``Plan Maroc Vert.'' We discuss the importance of OOAs for the preservation of on-farm genetic resources, food security and as models for future agroecosystems within the context of climate change. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Certain drivers of these declines are known; however, less is known about the interspecific trait differences that make certain species more susceptible to decline. Two traits that have implications for responding to rapidly changed environments may be particularly consequential for bumble bee populations: intraspecific body size variation and brain size. Bumble bee body size is highly variable and is likely adaptive at the colony level, and brain size correlates with cognitive traits (e.g., behavioral plastic-ity) in many groups. Trait variation and plasticity may buffer species against negative effects of rapidly changed environments. Using phylogenetically controlled analyses of 31 North American bumble bee species, we find that higher intraspecific body size variation is associated with species having increased their relative abundance over time. However, this variation does not significantly interact with tongue length, another trait thought to influence bees' decline susceptibility. Head size, a proxy for brain size, is not correlated with change in relative abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that variation in body size makes species less susceptible to decline in rapidly altered environments and suggests that this variation is important to the success of bumble bee populations.},

To demonstrate that the animals reacted to the elevated temperature. The expression of heat shock protein (HSP) was determined. Using an antibody raised against HSP70, it was found by Western blotting that the animals specifically express a 45 kDa polypeptide after heat treatment. It was shown that even after 10 min of heat treatment the steady-state concentration of trehalose drops by 40\% from a base level of 13 nmol/mg protein. The activity of the trehalose-degrading enzyme, trehalase, remained unchanged. Additional early biomarkers for thermal stress include the enzyme activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the concentration of glutathione (GSH). After 5-min the activity of GST decreased by 40\%. Similarly, the concentration of GSH dropped by 50\% after 15 to 20 min exposure. The original levels of the biomarkers, trehalose, GSH and GST, were reached again after a recovery period of about 180 min.

  abstract = {There is now ample evidence that biodiversity stabilizes aggregated ecosystem functions, such as primary production, in changing environments. In primary producer systems, this stabilizing effect is found to be driven by higher functional resistance (i.e., reduced changes in functions by environmental changes) rather than through higher functional resilience (i.e., rapid recovery following environmental changes) in more diverse systems. The stability of aggregated ecosystem functions directly depends on changes in species composition and by consequence their functional contributions to ecosystem functions. Still, it remains only theoretically explored how biodiversity can stabilize ecosystem functions by affecting compositional stability. Here, we demonstrate how biodiversity effects on compositional stability drive biodiversity effects on functional stability in diatom communities. In a microcosm experiment, we exposed 39 communities of five different levels of species richness (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 species) to three concentrations of a chemical stressor (0, 25, and 250 {$\mu$}g/L atrazine) for four weeks, after which all communities were transferred to atrazine-free medium for three more weeks. Biodiversity simultaneously increased, increasing functional and compositional resistance, but decreased functional and compositional resilience. These results confirm the theoretically proposed link between biodiversity effects on functional and compositional stability in primary producer systems, and provide a mechanistic underpinning for observed biodiversity-stability relationships. Finally, we discuss how higher compositional stability can be expected to become increasingly important in stabilizing ecosystem functions under field conditions when multiple environmental stressors fluctuate simultaneously.},

Because species interactions shape biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, changes in per capita interactions under stress (as predicted by the stress gradient hypothesis) can be an important driver of stress-induced changes in these relationships. To test this hypothesis, we measure productivity in microalgae communities along a diversity and herbicide gradient. On the basis of additive partitioning and a mechanistic community model, we demonstrate that changes in per capita interactions do not explain effects of herbicide stress on the biodiversity-productivity relationship. Instead, assuming that the per capita interactions remain unaffected by stress, causing species densities to only change through differences in stress tolerance, suffices to predict the stress-induced changes in the biodiversity-productivity relationship and community composition. We discuss how our findings set the stage for developing theory on how environmental stress changes biodiversity effects on ecosystem functions.},

Most extrapolation procedures are based on the implicit assumption that species sensitivities are random with regard to their functional traits. Here, we explore how nonrandomness in species sensitivities affects how species-level and ecosystem level effects of chemical exposure correspond. The effect of a correlation between the trait value under control conditions and the sensitivity of the trait to chemical stress is studied for two traits (per capita growth rate and monoculture yield) under constant and temporary exposure. Theoretical model predictions are thereby validated against a 3-week microcosm experiment, in which eight marine diatoms systems with different correlations between trait values and sensitivities were temporary (1 week) or constantly (3 weeks) exposed to two concentrations of the herbicide atrazine (100 and 250 {$\mu$}g L-1). Negative correlations increased the reduction in ecosystem functioning (productivity) by atrazine for both traits. However, correlations in the per capita growth rate affected productivity only shortly following changes in environmental conditions, whereas correlations in the monoculture yield affected productivity throughout exposure. Correlations between species sensitivities and functional trait values can thus help to identify when ecosystem-level effects are likely to exceed species-level effects.},

This study quantifies the thermal performance curves (TPCs) of FTs in the cosmopolitan model diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, to advance understanding of trade-offs between physiological (photoacclimation, carbon fixation, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate uptake) and morphological traits (cell volume and frustule silicification). We show that each FT has substantial phenotypic plasticity and exhibits a unique TPC, varying in both shape and thermal optimum, and diverging from the growth response. The TPC for growth was symmetric with a thermal optimum (Topt) of 18\textdegree C. In comparison, the TPC for primary productivity was warm-skewed with a Topt around 21\textdegree C, whereas frustule silicification decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Together, this suggests that the optimal temperature for overall fitness is a balance of trade-offs in the underlying functional traits. Moreover, these results demonstrate that growth is not necessarily an accurate estimate of overall biogeochemical performance and that temperature change will likely influence elemental fluxes such as carbon and silicon. Finally, we show that temperature-driven changes in individual traits e.g., photoacclimation, can mimic responses experienced under other environmental stressors (high light) and so a multi-trait assessment is essential for accurate interpretation of the cellular impact of warming. This study also reveals that multi-trait analysis, in the context of TPCs, provides insight into the cellular physiology regulating the whole cell response and has the potential to provide better estimates of how diatom-mediated biogeochemical fluxes are likely to be impacted in the context of ocean warming. Analyzing the response of multiple traits more comprehensively over other environmental gradients may therefore provide a useful framework to advance understanding of how taxon-specific functional traits will respond to multifaceted ocean change.},

Those minimal state dynamics can be identified using the differential geometric approach to the observability of nonlinear systems, but the theory is limited to only analytical systems. In this paper, we extend the notion of nonlinear observable decomposition to the more general class of data-informed systems. We employ Koopman operator theory, which encapsulates nonlinear dynamics in linear models, allowing us to bridge the gap between linear and nonlinear observability notions. We propose a new algorithm to learn Koopman operator representations that capture the system dynamics while ensuring that the output performance measure is in the span of its observables. We show that a transformation of this linear, output-inclusive Koopman model renders a new minimum Koopman representation. This representation embodies only the observable portion of the nonlinear observable decomposition of the original system. A prime application of this theory is to identify genes in biological systems that correspond to specific phenotypes, the performance measure. We simulate two biological gene networks and demonstrate that the observability of Koopman operators can successfully identify genes that drive each phenotype. We anticipate our novel system identification tool will effectively discover reduced gene networks that drive complex behaviors in biological systems.},

Superior growth of quagga mussels was most pronounced at low food levels. We found no significant differences in per capita clearance rates (CR), functional responses, or feeding behavior between zebra and quagga mussels fed Chlamydomonas, Nannochloris, or mixed suspensions of Nannochloris and clay. Per capita CR ranged from 0.018 to 0.402 L.mussel(-1).h(-1) for zebra mussels and from 0.010 to 0.407 L.mussel(-1).h(-1) for quagga mussels. Because quagga mussels had more biomass per unit shell length, we found lower biomass-specific CR for quagga mussels. When fed natural seston, zebra and quagga mussels could selectively reject inorganic material and at the lowest seston level the assimilation efficiency of quagga mussels (81\%) was significantly higher than that of zebra mussels (63\%). Our experiments suggest that quagga mussels can survive, grow, and feed as well or better than zebra mussels in epilimnetic waters with either low or high productivity.},

Great propagule pressure would enable invasive species to colonize new areas overcoming the resistance of native species. Many highly invasive aquatic macrophytes regenerate from vegetative propagules, but few studies have experimentally investigated the importance of propagule pressure and biotic resistance, and their interaction, in determining invasion success. By manipulating both recipient habitat and the input of vegetative propagules of the invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea in mesocosm, we examined whether higher propagule pressure would overcome the resistance of a native congeneric (Caulerpa prolifera) and influence its performance. With the native, C. cylindracea population frond number decreased irrespectively of pressure level. High propagule pressure did not increase stolon length and single plant size decreased due to the effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Native biomass decreased with increasing C. cylindracea propagule pressure. These results indicate that higher propagule pressure may fail in enhancing C. cylindracea invasion success in habitats colonized by the native species, and they suggest that biotic resistance and propagule pressure co-regulate the invasion process. These findings emphasize the need to preserve/restore native seaweed populations and may help to design effective management actions to prevent further C. cylindracea spread.},

  abstract = {Concern is growing about the potential effects of interacting multiple stressors, especially as the global climate changes. We provide a comprehensive review of multiple stressor interactions in coral reef ecosystems, which are widely considered to be one of the most sensitive ecosystems to global change. First, we synthesized coral reef studies that examined interactions of two or more stressors, highlighting stressor interactions (where one stressor directly influences another) and potentially synergistic effects on response variables (where two stressors interact to produce an effect that is greater than purely additive). For stressor-stressor interactions, we found 176 studies that examined at least 2 of the 13 stressors of interest. Applying network analysis to analyze relationships between stressors, we found that pathogens were exacerbated by more costressors than any other stressor, with ca. 78\% of studies reporting an enhancing effect by another stressor. Sedimentation, storms, and water temperature directly affected the largest number of other stressors. Pathogens, nutrients, and crown-of-thorns starfish were the most-influenced stressors. We found 187 studies that examined the effects of two or more stressors on a third dependent variable. The interaction of irradiance and temperature on corals has been the subject of more research (62 studies, 33\% of the total) than any other combination of stressors, with many studies reporting a synergistic effect on coral symbiont photosynthetic performance (n = 19). Second, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature on this most-studied interaction (irradiance and temperature). We found that the mean effect size of combined treatments was statistically indistinguishable from a purely additive interaction, although it should be noted that the sample size was relatively small (n = 26). Overall, although in aggregate a large body of literature examines stressor effects on coral reefs and coral organisms, considerable gaps remain for numerous stressor interactions and effects, and insufficient quantitative evidence exists to suggest that the prevailing type of stressor interaction is synergistic. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The choice of characterization of the system carries with it implicit assumptions about fundamental attributes such as whether the system is classical or quantum mechanical or equivalently whether the individuals are distinguishable or indistinguishable. We show that the correct procedure entails the maximization of the relative entropy subject to known constraints and, additionally, requires knowledge of the behavior of the system in the absence of these constraints.

To investigate the relationship between germination niche breadth and sensitivity to climate change, we selected three North American perennials: Physalis longifolia, Asclepias syriaca and Penstemon digitalis. Dormancy loss and germination requirements were determined for seeds from populations along a Midwest US latitudinal gradient. Fresh seeds were incubated at 1, 5, 9, 15/6, 20/10, 25/15 and 30/15\textdegree C, and seeds cold stratified at 1, 5 and 9\textdegree C for 4\textendash 12 weeks were incubated at 15/6, 20/10, 25/15 and 30/15\textdegree C. Germination niche breadth (Levins' Bn) was calculated from final germination proportion. In addition, a sequence of temperatures evaluated the effect of future warming on germination phenology. Germination differed significantly among populations and collection latitudes (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), but variation did not have a latitudinal pattern. Niche breadth was widest for Physalis and Asclepias and narrowest for Penstemon (P {$\leq$} 0.05), with implications for germination phenology. Germination shifted to autumn for Physalis and Asclepias under future warming in northern collection regions, and shifted earlier in spring for Penstemon regardless of region. Due to limited stratification and germination requirements, resulting in the narrowest niche breadth, we initially predicted Penstemon to be most at-risk, as future warming would fall outside its stratification envelope. However, species with wide niche breadths (Physalis and Asclepias) may be more vulnerable to climate change due to maladaptive shifts in germination phenology.},

  abstract = {Plant intraspecific variability has been proposed as a key mechanism by which plants adapt to environmental change. In boreal forests where nitrogen availability is strongly limited, nitrogen addition happens indirectly through atmospheric N deposition and directly through industrial forest fertilization. These anthropogenic inputs of N have numerous environmental consequences, including shifts in plant species composition and reductions in plant species diversity. However, we know less about how genetic differences within plant populations determine how species respond to eutrophication in boreal forests. According to plant defense theories, nitrogen addition will cause plants to shift carbon allocation more towards growth and less to chemical defense, potentially enhancing vulnerability to antagonists. Aspens are keystone species in boreal forests that produce condensed tannins to serve as chemical defense. We conducted an experiment using ten Populus tremula genotypes from the Swedish Aspen Collection that express extreme levels of baseline investment into foliar condensed tannins. We investigated whether investment into growth and phenolic defense compounds in young plants varied in response to two nitrogen addition levels, corresponding to atmospheric N deposition and industrial forest fertilization. Nitrogen addition generally caused growth to increase, and tannin levels to decrease; however, individualistic responses among genotypes were found for height growth, biomass of specific tissues, root:shoot ratios, and tissue lignin and N concentrations. A genotype's baseline ability to produce and store condensed tannins also influenced plant responses to N, although this effect was relatively minor. High-tannin genotypes tended to grow less biomass under low nitrogen levels and more at the highest fertilization level. Thus, the ability in aspen to produce foliar tannins is likely associated with a steeper reaction norm of growth responses, which suggests a higher plasticity to nitrogen addition, and potentially an advantage when adapting to higher concentrations of soil nitrogen. \textcopyright{} 2015 Bandau et al.

In multispecies communities, the only strong effect of non-heritable intraspecific variation is to reduce expected species richness. However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns.

  abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

  abstract = {Predation often deviates from the law of mass action: many micro- and meso-scale experiments have shown that consumption saturates with resource abundance, and decreases due to interference between consumers. But does this observation hold at macro-ecological scales, spanning many species and orders of magnitude in biomass? If so, what are its consequences for large-scale ecological patterns and dynamics? We perform a meta-analysis of predator\textendash prey pairs of mammals, birds and reptiles, and show that total predation rates appear to increase, not as the product of predator and prey densities following the Lotka\textendash Volterra (mass action) model, but rather as the square root of that product. This suggests a phenomenological power-law expression of the effective cross-ecosystem predation rate. We discuss whether the same power-law may hold dynamically within an ecosystem, and assuming that it does, we explore its consequences in a simple food chain model. The empirical exponents fall close to the boundary between regimes of donor and consumer limitation. Exponents on this boundary are singular in multiple ways. First, they maximize predator abundance and some stability metrics. Second, they create proportionality relations between biomass and productivity, both within and between trophic levels. These intuitive relations do not hold in general in mass action models, yet they are widely observed empirically. These results provide evidence of mechanisms limiting predation across multiple ecological scales. Some of this evidence was previously associated with donor control, but we show that it supports a wider range of possibilities, including forms of consumer control. As limiting consumption counter-intuitively allows larger populations, it is worthwhile to reconsider whether the observed predation rates arise from microscopic mechanisms, or could hint at selective pressure at the population level.},

Combining metabolic and food-web theory, we calculate annual energy fluxes to model impacts of land-use intensification on multitrophic ecosystem functioning. We demonstrate a 51\% reduction in energy fluxes from forest to oil palm communities. Species loss clearly explains variation in energy fluxes; however, this relationship depends on land-use systems and functional feeding guilds, whereby predators are the most heavily affected. Biodiversity decline from forest to oil palm is thus accompanied by even stronger reductions in functionality, threatening to severely limit the functional resilience of communities to cope with future global changes.},

Warming induces shifts in species' distributions as they track temperature changes, but this can be hindered in fragmented landscapes. Corridors connecting habitat patches might ameliorate the combined effects of fragmentation and global warming. 2.Using novel automated tracking methods, the movement of woodlice (Oniscus asellus) ranging in body size from 15.3 to 108.6 mg was quantified across a temperature range from 15 to 25\textdegree{} C as they moved around an experimental fragmented landscape. We used confirmatory path analysis to test causal effects of temperature and body size on individual movement and corridor crossing rates between two habitat patches. 3.Results showed that woodlice behaved differently in corridors than patches by moving, on average, faster and more often. This is congruent with natural systems where corridors generally provide lower quality habitat than patches. Although metabolic theory suggests positive scaling of movement with body temperature (up to a peak) and body size, we found that corridor crossing rate was i) not directly affected by body size, and ii) negatively influenced by temperature, possibly due to its indirect effects via humidity. 4.Our path model revealed that metabolic scaling could only explain temperature effects on maximum body velocity, but decision-based behaviour explained most variation in corridor crossing rates. This led to direct and indirect effects of temperature and size on individual movement between habitat patches. 5.Our findings suggest that increasing mean global temperatures, coupled with increasing habitat fragmentation, could have synergistic negative impacts on populations through a combination of physiological and behavioural factors that mediate individual responses to temperature and fragmentation.},

Understanding the mechanisms of spatial population dynamics is crucial for the successful management of exploited species and ecosystems. However, the underlying mechanisms of spatial distribution are generally complex due to the concurrent forcing of both densitydependent species interactions and density-independent environmental factors. Despite the high economic value and central ecological importance of cod in the Baltic Sea, the drivers of its spatio-temporal population dynamics have not been analytically investigated so far. In this paper, we used an extensive trawl survey dataset in combination with environmental data to investigate the spatial dynamics of the distribution of the Eastern Baltic cod during the past three decades using Generalized Additive Models. The results showed that adult cod distribution was mainly affected by cod population size, and to a minor degree by smallscale hydrological factors and the extent of suitable reproductive areas. As population size decreases, the cod population concentrates to the southern part of the Baltic Sea, where the preferred more marine environment conditions are encountered. Using the fitted models, we predicted the Baltic cod distribution back to the 1970s and a temporal index of cod spatial occupation was developed. Our study will contribute to the management and conservation of this important resource and of the ecosystem where it occurs, by showing the forces shaping its spatial distribution and therefore the potential response of the population to future exploitation and environmental changes.},

Biochemical reference intervals are the ranges of values of specific analytes at the population level that are expected to encompass 95\% of "normal" individuals. However, how do we define a "normal" lobster? Homarus americanus (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) is a sublittoral ectotherm with a limited homeostatic ability to adapt to rapid environmental changes. An experiment was designed to measure the changes that may occur in selected analytes as wild lobsters "acclimate" to captivity. Biological variation was minimized by the maintenance of strict environmental conditions, uniform life stages, nutrition, and molt status. The results of this experiment suggest that elevations in hemolymph levels of glucose, L-lactate, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, ammonia, ionic calcium, and a decrease in ionic potassium may be indicative of the stress associated with capture, handling, and emersion hypoxia. Although the data demonstrate a considerable intraspecific variation in most analytes during the acclimation process, these reference intervals may be useful in the interpretation of clinical findings in lobsters held in captivity for research or exhibition in public aquaria.},

Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization.},

Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a `Protection Paradox'. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High-quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate.},

Parallel dilution experiments were performed with 30 kDa ultrafiltrate (virus and grazer-free diluent) and 0.2 pra filtered seawater (grazer-free, but virus-containing diluent). Specific viral lysis rates were calculated from the difference in P. globosa growth rates between the 2 dilution series after 24 h incubation under natural conditions. The validity of this method was tested using a culture of P. globosa infected with a known P. globosa virus (PgV). The field data show that virally induced mortality can be a substantial loss factor for P. globosa single cells (up to 0.35 d(-1)), comparable to that due to microzooplankton grazing (up to 0.4 d(-1)). Viral lysis was the major cause of total P. globosa cell lysis. Assuming no loss due to sinking, viral lysis accounted for 5 to 66 \% of the total mortality of R globosa single cells. Viral lysis and total putative PgV abundance increased concomitantly with abundance of P. globosa single cells whilst the increase in infective PgV was delayed. This delay may be caused by the formation of transparent exopolymeric particles that are generated when P. globosa colonies disrupt and are known to passively adsorb viruses. Viruses and microzooplankton were shown to be major controlling agents of P. globosa single cells, although their relative significance varied over the course of the bloom and between years.},

For the smallest picoeukaryotes (group I), viral lysis was responsible for 50-100\% of the total cell losses, with rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 d(-1). Viral lysis rates were positively linked to the abundance and contribution of large genome-sized (180-225 kb) putative algal viruses.

For Prochlorococcus, both viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing rates were very low (0-0.1 d(-1)).

The effect of irradiance levels on the host-virus interactions differed for the two algal host-virus systems examined. For P. globosa, the LL-acclimated cultures showed a 4 h prolonged latent period (11-16 h), which may be related to the subsaturated growth observed at this irradiance. The burst size was reduced by 50\% at LL and HL compared to ML (525 PgV . cell(-1)). The fraction of infectious viruses, however, remained unchanged. Viral replication was prevented when the LL P. globosa cultures were kept in darkness (up to 48 h) but recovered when placed back into the light. PgV-07T still replicated in the dark for the ML- and HL-acclimated cultures, but viral yield was reduced by 50\%-85\%. For M. pusilla, the burst size (285-360 MpV . cell(-1)), the infectivity, and the latent period of MpV-02T (7-11 h) remained unaffected by the incident light. Conversely, darkness not only inhibited MpV replication but also resulted in substantial cell lysis of the noninfected cultures.

  abstract = {Variation in natural selection across heterogeneous landscapes often produces (a) among-population differences in phenotypic traits, (b) trait-by-environment associations, and (c) higher fitness of local populations. Using a broad literature review of common garden studies published between 1941 and 2017, we documented the commonness of these three signatures in plants native to North America's Great Basin, an area of extensive restoration and revegetation efforts, and asked which traits and environmental variables were involved. We also asked, independent of geographic distance, whether populations from more similar environments had more similar traits. From 327 experiments testing 121 taxa in 170 studies, we found 95.1\% of 305 experiments reported among-population differences, and 81.4\% of 161 experiments reported trait-by-environment associations. Locals showed greater survival in 67\% of 24 reciprocal experiments that reported survival, and higher fitness in 90\% of 10 reciprocal experiments that reported reproductive output. A meta-analysis on a subset of studies found that variation in eight commonly measured traits was associated with mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature at the source location, with notably strong relationships for flowering phenology, leaf size, and survival, among others. Although the Great Basin is sometimes perceived as a region of homogeneous ecosystems, our results demonstrate widespread habitat-related population differentiation and local adaptation. Locally sourced plants likely harbor adaptations at rates and magnitudes that are immediately relevant to restoration success, and our results suggest that certain key traits and environmental variables should be prioritized in future assessments of plants in this region.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, many species are responding to ongoing climate change with shifts in distribution, abundance, phenology, or behavior. Consequently, natural-resource managers face increasingly urgent conservation questions related to biodiversity loss, expansion of invasive species, and deteriorating ecosystem services. We argue that our ability to address these questions is hampered by the lack of explicit consideration of species' adaptive capacity (AC). AC is the ability of a species or population to cope with climatic changes and is characterized by three fundamental components: phenotypic plasticity, dispersal ability, and genetic diversity. However, few studies simultaneously address all elements; often, AC is confused with sensitivity or omitted altogether from climate-change vulnerability assessments. Improved understanding, consistent definition, and comprehensive evaluations of AC are needed. Using classic ecological-niche theory as an analogy, we propose a new paradigm that considers fundamental and realized AC: the former reflects aspects inherent to species, whereas the latter denotes how extrinsic factors constrain AC to what is actually expressed or observed. Through this conceptualization, we identify ecological attributes contributing to AC, outline areas of research necessary to advance understanding of AC, and provide examples demonstrating how the inclusion of AC can better inform conservation and natural-resource management.},

We present a five-part framework based on experimental designs from the phenotypic plasticity literature to quantify AMF intraspecific trait variation in a nutrient cycling context. Framework experiments involve exposing AMF replicates to different environmental conditions and recording trait values to quantify the (i) degree of variation, (ii) reversibility of traits, (iii) relationships among traits, (iv) adaptive nature of traits and (v) potential for trait variation to evolve. We include a phenotypic trajectory analysis of a simulated data set to illustrate relationships among traits.

Non-indigenous species (NIS) can impact marine biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. Once introduced into a new region, secondary dispersal is limited by the physiology of the organism in relation to the ambient environment and by complex interactions between a suite of ecological factors such as presence of predators, competitors, and parasites. Early prediction of dispersal potential and future 'area of impact' is challenging, but also a great asset in taking appropriate management actions. Aerobic scope (AS) in fish has been linked to various fitness-related parameters, and may be valuable in determining dispersal potential of aquatic invasive species in novel environments. Round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, one of the most wide-ranging invasive fish species in Europe and North America, currently thrives in brackish and fresh water, but its ability to survive in high salinity waters is unknown to date. We show that AS in round goby is reduced by 30\% and blood plasma osmolality increased (indicating reduced capacity for osmoregulation) at salinities approaching oceanic conditions, following slow ramping (5 PSU per week) and subsequent long-term acclimation to salinities ranging between 0 and 30 PSU (8 days at final treatment salinities before blood plasma osmolality measurements, 12-20 additional days before respirometry). Survival was also reduced at the highest salinities yet a significant proportion (61\%) of the fish survived at 30 PSU. Reduced physiological performance at the highest salinities may affect growth and competitive ability under oceanic conditions, but to what extent reduced AS and osmoregulatory capacity will slow the current 30 km year -1 rate of advance of the species through the steep salinity gradient from the brackish Baltic Sea and into the oceanic North Sea remains speculative. An unintended natural experiment is in progress to test whether the rate of advance slows down. At the current rate of advance the species will reach the oceanic North Sea by 2018/2019, therefore time for taking preventative action is short.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental ``drivers''. We review the theory behind alternative sta- ble states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We dis- cuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demon- strate the existence of alternative stable states.},

Theory predicts that phytoplankton vertical distribution should be associated with these gradients as different taxa maximize resource access, while minimizing competitive interactions using niche partitioning. We examined the relationships between spatial overlap (SO) of four major phytoplankton spectral groups with key biogeochemical and morphometric environmental parameters across 52 north temperate lakes. SO decreased primarily with greater thermal stratification, and where more light was available and nutrient levels lower. When greater SO did occur in highly stratified lakes, taxonomic diversity was favored through increased species evenness, but not richness. Taxonomic richness, on the other hand, increased in lakes with greater light availability, coincident with low SO. Similarly, niche partitioning associated with greater functional diversity in the range of traits present in the communities was detected when SO was low in clear lakes. Overall, our results indicate that the ability of phytoplankton to spatially separate and utilize large portions of the water column is important for augmenting species and functional trait richness related to motility and resource acquisition. However, our study also suggests that community evenness is favored when phytoplankton distributions overlap in deep chlorophyll maxima associated with stratified lakes. Lakes},

Typically the focus of most monitoring programmes has been to quantify temporal and spatial variation in the abundance of organisms, along with the diversity and composition of biological communities to assess acute and chronic impacts. However, while such measures provide important indicators of change, they are less useful when trying to identify more chronic impacts, especially for species that are long-lived. Sponges are an important component of marine systems world-wide and they have received increased focus in recent years as a result of global reports of changing sponge abundance, particularly in tropical systems. While many studies have reported spatial and temporal variation in sponge assemblage composition and abundance, far fewer studies have considered specific monitoring of other aspects of sponge ecology, particularly ecological processes, or physiology. Here we identify a range of different potential indicators, primarily focused on shallow water (\textexclamdown 40 m) sponges that could be applied to provide more-comprehensive sponge monitoring, and the potential for these indicators to respond to different local and global scale anthropogenic impacts. While we focused on sponges, these indicators and our approach could be easily adapted to other marine groups. Applying broader and more comprehensive monitoring approaches will enable both chronic and sub-chronic impacts to be detected, and provide a more holistic view of overall ecosystem health and population fitness.},

In this study, we challenge the trait-based ecology framework by comparing congeneric exotic (European) and native (North American) tree species showing similar resource-use functional trait values. The trait-based framework suggests that two functionally equivalent species should play similar roles in a community, resulting in similar interactions and performances. However, several studies showed that when growing in mixtures, exotic species that are functionally equivalent to native species benefitted from enemy release, resulting in a reduced apparent competition. We hypothesize that exotic species should be more productive than native species because the exotic species benefit from reduced apparent competition due to enemy release rather than from possessing more competitive resource-use functional traits. We study a diversity experiments, part of the International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT), composed of two identical sites, each with two orthogonal diversity gradients: species richness and functional diversity. The functional gradient consists of species combinations of equal richness but increasing functional diversity, using different combinations of species provenance to assess the relationship between productivity, functional diversity and species provenance, independently of species richness. We grew a total of 12 species (six native and six exotic) in different combinations of one-, two- and six-species mixtures. The exotic species were selected based on their functional equivalence to their native congeneric species. Eight years after planting, we found that exotic species were more productive than native species, but only at high functional diversity. Results indicate that exotic species overall benefit from a reduced apparent competition, and that exotic-increased productivity at high functional diversity is consistent with the enemy release hypothesis. After 8 years, exotic species were more productive overall than their native counterparts, but only in the most functionally diverse communities. This study represents a first step in understanding the relative importance of complementarity in resource-use and apparent competition in a context of an exotic tree species invasion.

A community may be considered as a black box in the sense that the individual species grow and interact in complicated ways that are difficult to discern. Yet, by observing the response (output) of the system to natural or human\textemdash induced disturbances (inputs), information can be gained regarding the character and strengths of species interactions. We decline a perturbation as selective alteration of the density of one or more members of the community, and we distinguish two quite different kinds of perturbations. A PULSE perturbation is a relatively instantaneous alteration of species numbers, after which the system is studied as it 'relaxes' back to its previous equilibrium state. A PRESS perturbation is a sustained alteration of species densities (often a complete elimination of particular species): it is maintained until the unperturbed species reach a new equilibrium. The measure of interest in PRESS perturbation is the net change in densities of the unperturbed species. There is a very important difference between these two approaches: PULSE experiments yield information only on direct interactions (e.g. terms in the interaction matrix), while PRESS experiments yield information on direct interactions mixed together with the indirect effects mediated through other species in the community. We develop mathematical techniques that yield measures of ecological interaction between species from both types of experimental designs. Particular caution must be exercised in interpreting results form PRESS experiments, particularly when some species are lumped into functional categories and others are neglected altogether in the experimental design. We also suggest mathematical methods to deal with temporal and random variation during experiments. Finally, we critically review techniques that rely on natural variation in numbers to estimate species interaction coefficients. The problems with such studies are formidable.},

Results indicated reciprocal interactions between multiple stressors and their elaboration by a quantitative hazard model based on the relevance and magnitude of effects, highlighted a different sensitivity of analysed tissues. Due to cellular adaptations to high basal Cd content, digestive gland appeared more tolerant toward other prooxidant stressors, but sensitive to variations of the metal.

Among these are measures of diversity and complexity in ecosystems: species richness, diversity indices, functional groups, keystone species, connectance, etc, all of which may be difficult to relate to ecosystem function. Several important distinctions, when testing diversity-function relationships empirically, are discussed: Diversity of functional groups, diversity within functional groups vs. total diversity; manipulating variables such as body-size distributions vs. manipulating diversity per se; effects of diversity vs. effects of biomass; and diversity-function relations under stable vs. changing conditions or perturbations. It is argued that for the management and development of sustainable ecosystems, it is probably more important to understand the linkages between key species or functional groups and ecosystem function, rather than focusing on species diversity. This is because there are possible mechanistic relations between what species do in ecosystems and ecosystem function. Diversity, being an abstract and aggregated property of the species in the context of communities and ecosystems, lacks such direct relations to ecosystem functions. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50 ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.},

Such intraspecific variation occurred despite a constant chromosome number (2n = 28) and no obvious differences in karyotype. Plants originating from botanic garden populations growing in cultivation had significantly (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) larger DNA amounts than plants collected from wild populations. Moreover, variation in DNA amount within either the 'cultivated' or the 'wild' groups was not significant. As the environment in which plants are kept in botanic gardens is clearly different to the natural habitat for M. effusum, it seems likely that the difference in nuclear DNA amount is causally related, perhaps through its nucleotypic effects, to microclimate adaptation. These results suggest that at least some genotypes of M. effusum are fluid and sensitive to environmental change. Such data may have broad practical importance regarding plant responses to various environmental changes such as a nuclear winter and global warming, and implications for plant conservation and reintroduction. Milium effusum is a potentially useful plant material for studying the nature of intraspecific variation in DNA amount.}

The TLHM adequately described major trade-offs in traits amongst populations in all species. Some TLHM flow-based predictions were confirmed, with periodic traits (high fecundity) favoured at sites with greater flow seasonality and lower flow variability in two species, and equilibrium traits (large eggs) in more stable flow conditions in two species. Size at maturity was also inversely related to variability in one species. However, relationships contradicting the TLHM were also found. Coupled with the explanatory power of the TLHM for populations, supporting relationships suggest that synthesizing habitat template models with demographic life history theory could be valuable.

  abstract = {As atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, associated ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA) are predicted to cause declines in reef-building corals globally, shifting reefs from coral-dominated systems to those dominated by less sensitive species. Sponges are important structural and functional components of coral reef ecosystems, but despite increasing field-based evidence that sponges may be 'winners' in response to environmental degradation, our understanding of how they respond to the combined effects of OW and OA is limited. To determine the tolerance of adult sponges to climate change, four abundant Great Barrier Reef species were experimentally exposed to OW and OA levels predicted for 2100, under two CO2 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The impact of OW and OA on early life-history stages was also assessed for one of these species to provide a more holistic view of species impacts. All species were generally unaffected by conditions predicted under RCP6.0, although environmental conditions projected under RCP8.5 caused significant adverse effects: with elevated temperature decreasing the survival of all species, increasing levels of tissue necrosis and bleaching, elevating respiration rates and decreasing photosynthetic rates. OA alone had little adverse effect, even under RCP8.5 concentrations. Importantly, the interactive effect of OW and OA varied between species with different nutritional modes, with elevated pCO2 exacerbating temperature stress in heterotrophic species but mitigating temperature stress in phototrophic species. This antagonistic interaction was reflected by reduced mortality, necrosis and bleaching of phototrophic species in the highest OW/OA treatment. Survival and settlement success of Carteriospongia foliascens larvae were unaffected by experimental treatments, and juvenile sponges exhibited greater tolerance to OW than their adult counterparts. With elevated pCO2 providing phototrophic species with protection from elevated temperature, across different life stages, climate change may ultimately drive a shift in the composition of sponge assemblages towards a dominance of phototrophic species.},

Even though soils host a large fraction of biodiversity that underlies major ecosystem functions, studies exploring the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (sBEF) as influenced by global change drivers (GCDs) remain scarce. Here we highlight the need to decipher sBEF relationships under the effect of interactive GCDs that are intimately connected in a changing world. We first state that sBEF relationships depend on the type of function (e.g., C cycling or decomposition) and biodiversity facet (e.g., abundance, species richness, or biomass) considered. Then, we shed light on the impact of single and interactive GCDs on soil biodiversity and sBEF and show that results from scarce studies studying interactive effects range from antagonistic to additive to synergistic when two individual GCDs cooccur. This indicates the need for studies quantitatively accounting for the impacts of interactive GCDs on sBEF relationships. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimized methodological and experimental approaches to study sBEF in a changing world that will provide more valuable information on the real impact of (interactive) GCDs on sBEF. Together, we highlight the need to decipher the sBEF relationship in soils to better understand soil functioning under ongoing global changes, as changes in sBEF are of immediate importance for ecosystem functioning.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quan-titatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus may have relatively low P requirements in the field, and thus the particulate organic matter they produce would differ from the Redfield ratio (106C:16N:1P) often assumed for the production of new particulate organic matter in the sea.},

However, we know little about the interactive effects of both stressors and in particular about the interaction of increased climatic variability and biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. This should be remedied because larger climatic variability is one of the main features of climate change. Here, we demonstrated that temperature fluctuations led to changes in the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning. We used microcosm communities of different phytoplankton species richness and exposed them to a constant, mild, and severe temperature-fluctuating environment. Wider temperature fluctuations led to steeper biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning slopes, meaning that species loss had a stronger negative effect on ecosystem functioning in more fluctuating environments. For severe temperature fluctuations, the slope increased through time due to a decrease of the productivity of species-poor communities over time. We developed a theoretical competition model to better understand our experimental results and showed that larger differences in thermal tolerances across species led to steeper biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning slopes. Species-rich communities maintained their ecosystem functioning with increased fluctuation as they contained species able to resist the thermally fluctuating environments, while this was on average not the case in species-poor communities.

Since they represent the basis of aquatic ecosystems, the manner in which phytoplankton die critically determines the flow and fate of photosynthetically fixed organic matter (and associated elements), ultimately constraining nutrient flow. Programmed cell death (PCD) and associated pathway genes, which are triggered by a variety of abiotic (nutrient, light, osmotic) and biotic (virus infection, allelopathy) environmental stresses, have an integral grip on cell fate, and have shaped the ecological success and evolutionary trajectory of diverse phytoplankton lineages. A combination of physiological, biochemical, and genetic techniques in model algal systems has demonstrated a conserved molecular and mechanistic framework of stress surveillance, signaling, and death activation pathways, involving collective and coordinated participation of organelles, redox enzymes, metabolites, and caspase-like proteases. This mechanistic understanding has provided insight into the integration of sensing and transduction of stress signals into cellular responses, and the mechanistic interfaces between PCD, cell stress and virus infection pathways. It has also provided insight into the evolution of PCD in unicellular photoautotrophs, the impact of PCD on the fate of natural phytoplankton assemblages and its role in aquatic biogeochemical cycles.},

These effects interact with the community size structure: Communities of similarly sized species such as parasitoid-host systems are stabilized by warming and destabilized by eutrophication, whereas the diversity of size-structured predator-prey networks decreases strongly with warming, but decreases only weakly with eutrophication. Nonrandom extinction risks for generalists and specialists lead to higher connectance in networks without size structure and lower connectance in size-structured communities. Overall, our results unravel interactive impacts of warming and eutrophication and suggest that size structure may serve as an important proxy for predicting the community sensitivity to these global change stressors.},

The main factors, which must be considered for assaying enzymes, are temperature, pH, ionic strength and the proper concentrations of the essential components like substrates and enzymes. Standardization of these parameters would be desirable, but the diversity of the features of different enzymes prevents unification of assay conditions. Nevertheless, many enzymes, especially those from mammalian sources, possess a pH optimum near the physiological pH of 7.5, and the body temperature of about 37\textdegree C can serve as assay temperature, although because of experimental reasons frequently 25\textdegree C is preferred. But in many cases the particular features of the individual enzyme dictate special assay conditions, which can deviate considerably from recommended conditions. In addition, exact values for the concentrations of assay components such as substrates and enzymes cannot be given, unless general rules depending on the relative degree of saturation can be stated. Rules for performing the enzyme assay, appropriate handling, methodical aspects, preparation of assay mixtures and blanks, choice of the assay time, are discussed and suggestions to avoid frequent and trivial errors are given.

  abstract = {The Point Conception, California, USA region (hereafter PC) is one of the most important biogeographic and oceanographic discontinuities on the US west coast. Here we address how mesoscale oceanographic variability in the region around PC affects the growth of the competitively dominant species in the rocky intertidal assemblage: the mussel Mytilus californianus. Strong upwelling and high wave exposure dominate the California coast north of PC, and weak, seasonal upwelling and warmer water temperatures are characteristic of the region south/east of PC. We hypothesized that the oceanographic gradients in temperature, upwelling, wave exposure and productivity around PC would exert strong bottom-up influences on growth rates of mussels, potentially underlying large-scale differences in community structure around the PC region. We evaluated these predictions by measuring mussel growth rates across the PC region both in the intertidal and offshore on moorings. Intertidal mussels grew at much higher rates at sites south relative to north of PC and growth rates decreased in a gradient from south to north. The gradient in intertidal mussel growth around PC was uncorrelated with inshore concentrations of chlorophyll-a, and was most strongly correlated with the alongshore gradient in wave exposure and intertidal temperature. Mussels on moorings offshore from the intertidal sites grew at much higher rates than those in the corresponding intertidal areas, and mussel growth rates did not differ significantly among moored locations around PC. The gradient of increasing temperature from north to south among mooring sites was correlated with a decreasing gradient in productivity in the same direction, potentially contributing to equal and opposite effects on mussel growth at offshore moorings. This study suggests that environmental factors such as cold temperatures and high wave exposure contribute to the spatial pattern of decreasing mussel growth rates from south to north around PC, underlying large-scale patterns of community structure in this region. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While light and ROS could act synergistically on the impairment of photosynthesis, inducing photodamage and inhibiting photosystem II repair, acclimation to high irradiance is also thought to confer resistance to other stressors. To identify the respective roles of light and ROS in the photoinhibition process and detect a possible light-driven tolerance to oxidative stress, we compared the photophysiological and transcriptomic responses of Synechococcus sp. WH7803 acclimated to low light (LL) or high light (HL) to oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or methylviologen. While photosynthetic activity was much more affected in HL than in LL cells, only HL cells were able to recover growth and photosynthesis after the addition of 25 {$\mu$}m H(2)O(2). Depending upon light conditions and H(2)O(2) concentration, the latter oxidizing agent induced photosystem II inactivation through both direct damage to the reaction centers and inhibition of its repair cycle. Although the global transcriptome response appeared similar in LL and HL cells, some processes were specifically induced in HL cells that seemingly helped them withstand oxidative stress, including enhancement of photoprotection and ROS detoxification, repair of ROS-driven damage, and regulation of redox state. Detection of putative LexA binding sites allowed the identification of the putative LexA regulon, which was down-regulated in HL compared with LL cells but up-regulated by oxidative stress under both growth irradiances.},

  abstract = {The meaning of 'biodiversity' ranges from genetic makeups to communities, covering almost all biological phenomena, still remaining linked to species diversity. Ecosystems function through three basic cycles of matter and energy: extra specific cycles (biogeochemical cycles), intra specific cycles (life cycles and histories), and inter specific cycles (food webs). In an evolutionary framework, ecology is characterised by change: evolutionary processes never stop. Change is either structural or functional, or both. Palaeontology and long-term ecological series show that stable ecosystems do not exist, at least in structure. In non-linear systems like environmental ones, even small changes in biodiversity can cause sharp changes in ecosystem functioning, changing the shape of environmental attractors. The currently accepted definition of ecosystem functioning (the efficiency of biogeochemical cycles) is insufficient to account for ecosystem health. The efficiency of extra-, intra- and interspecific cycles must be taken into consideration in order to know 'who does what'. To account for the historical nature of ecological phenomena, the Historical Biodiversity Index is proposed, considering not only the present status of a given habitat type (in terms of species composition) but also its history. This will allow biodiversity crises to be identified, including potential extinction. Natural history and experimental ecology must cooperate to help untangle ecological complexity, merging biodiversity with the functioning of ecological systems. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.

We show that strong mismatches between community and climate can appear in the absence of demographic delays or limited species pools. Communities simulated using species response curves showed temporal changes of similar magnitude to those observed in natural communities of fishes and plankton, suggesting no overall delays in community change despite substantial unexplained variation from community assembly and other processes. Our approach can be considered as a null model that will be important to use when interpreting observed community responses to climate change and variability.},

  abstract = {Nongenetic inheritance is a potentially important but poorly understood factor in population responses to rapid environmental change. Accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance influences a diverse array of traits in all organisms and can allow for the transmission of environmentally induced phenotypic changes ('acquired traits'), as well as spontaneously arising and highly mutable variants. We review models of adaptation to changing environments under the assumption of a broadened model of inheritance that incorporates nongenetic mechanisms of transmission, and survey relevant empirical examples. Theory suggests that nongenetic inheritance can increase the rate of both phenotypic and genetic change and, in some cases, alter the direction of change. Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes - spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological - can be transmitted nongenetically. The presence of nongenetic inheritance therefore complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change. We outline a research program encompassing experimental studies that test for transgenerational effects of a range of environmental factors, followed by theoretical and empirical studies on the population-level consequences of such effects. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {In a widespread species, a matching of phenotypic traits to local environmental optima is generally attributed to site-specific adaptation. However, the same matching can occur via adaptive plasticity, without requiring genetic differences among populations. Adult sea kraits ( Laticauda saintgironsi ) are highly philopatric to small islands, but the entire population within the Neo-Caledonian Lagoon is genetically homogeneous because females migrate to the mainland to lay their eggs at communal sites; recruits disperse before settling, mixing up alleles. Consequently, any matching between local environments (e.g. prey sizes) and snake phenotypes (e.g. body sizes and relative jaw sizes (RJSs)) must be achieved via phenotypic plasticity rather than spatial heterogeneity in gene frequencies. We sampled 13 snake colonies spread along an approximately 200 km northwest\textendash southeast gradient ( n {$>$} 4500 individuals) to measure two morphological features that affect maximum ingestible prey size in gape-limited predators: body size and RJS. As proxies of habitat quality (HQ), we used protection status, fishing pressure and lagoon characteristics (lagoon width and distance of islands to the barrier reef). In both sexes, spatial variation in body sizes and RJSs was linked to HQ; albeit in different ways, consistent with sex-based divergences in foraging ecology. Strong spatial divergence in morphology among snake colonies, despite genetic homogeneity, supports the idea that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate speciation by creating multiple phenotypically distinct subpopulations shaped by their environment.},

They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.

Sampling bias in geographic space leads to localities that may also be biased in environmental space. If so, the model can overfit to those biases. As a preliminary test addressing this issue, we used Maxent, bioclimatic variables, and occurrence localities of a broadly distributed Malagasy tenrec, Microgale cowani (Tenrecidae: Oryzorictinae). We modeled the abiotically suitable area of this species using three distinct datasets: unfiltered, spatially filtered, and rarefied unfiltered localities. To quantify overfitting and model performance, we calculated evaluation AUC, the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC (=AUC diff ), and omission rates. Models made with the filtered dataset showed lower overfitting and better performance than the other two suites of models, having lower omission rates and AUC diff , and a higher AUC evaluation . Additionally, the rarefied unfiltered dataset performed better than the unfiltered one for three evaluation metrics, likely because the larger one reinforced the biases. These results indicate that spatial filtering of occurrence localities may allow biogeographers to produce better models. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Within species differences in behaviour can therefore be expected to relate to differences in flight morphology, not only between males and females but also between same-sex members when they use different behavioural strategies. In female polymorphic damselflies, one female morph is considered a male mimic that resembles the male's body colour and behaviour (andro-morph), whereas the other is dissimilar (gynomorph). Here, we questioned whether males, andromorphs, and gynomorphs of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum (Charpentier, 1840) differ in flight morphology, with andromorphs being more similar to males than gynomorphs. In addition, we evaluated whether differences in flight morphology are consistent or whether some morphs are more plastic in response to seasonal environmental fluctuations. Most morphometrics showed similar seasonal plasticity for males and both female morphs, which could only partly be explained from allometry. Consistent with high manoeuvrability in flight, males had broader wings and lower wing loading than females. Variation between female morphs was less pronounced, with no consistent differences in length, aspect ratio, total surface, and wing loading. However, we detected morph-specific differences in shape and width, with andromorphs having broader wings than gynomorphs similarly to males.}

Isotopic values in serially sampled whiskers of 34 leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx, HL), 13 crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga, LC) and 14 Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii, LW) seals were measured. Two clusters of leopard seals were identified based on their {$\delta$}15N values: a high-trophic level group (HLhigh) and a low-trophic level group (HLlow). Overlap in SEAc was only seen between HL and LC, while HL and LW showed an overlap in their convex hulls, but no overlap in SEAc. Diet compositions estimated using Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed intra- and interspecific differences among seals. For leopard seals highest dietary contributor was krill, while for HLhigh krill and fish\textsubscript{c}ephalopod were the main contributors. Mixing models run separately for each HL seal showed a large variation in the proportional contribution of krill (12\textendash 90\%) compared to the other sources (cephalopods, fish, penguins and seals). The crabeater seals almost exclusively consumed krill, with a low contribution of the other prey. Weddell seals, on the other hand, showed a high proportion of fish and a lower contribution of cephalopods and penguins, while the contribution of krill seemed to be minimal. This study is the first to compare isotopic niches of three Antarctic seals from the WAP. Our results indicate that crabeater and leopard seals seem to have a strong and a considerable dependence on krill, respectively. Although the WAP is characterized by an unusually high production of Antarctic krill the large community of vertebrate predators that feed upon this resource (penguins, seals and baleen whales) should be especially vulnerable under future scenarios of reduction of krill biomass. Under the current drastic environmental changes in the WAP, continuing to monitor WAP seal diets and the relative contribution of krill to them will help understand the degree to which climate change may alter the population dynamics of these upper trophic level species. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {The Mediterranean flora and fauna seem particularly rich. One of the reasons for this wealth is their high rate of endemism. In addition, the Mediterranean harbours a large variety of communities. Some of them are unique, giving the Mediterranean its touch of originality. A number of these species and communities are threatened by human activities. Until recently, the legal protection of marine species mainly concerned mammals, turtles and birds. Since 1996, 55 species of Mediterranean marine macrophytes, invertebrates and fishes were registered in Appendices I and II of the Conventions of Bern and Barcelona. Of course, the protection of species is intimately linked to the protection of their habitats and resources: a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were set up. In addition to the setting up of conservatories for threatened species and habitats, the targets of MPAs are to establish no-take areas where fish density and sex-ratio make spawning possible (which subsequently export eggs, larvae and adults to surrounding non protected areas) and to manage the different uses of the sea (e.g. artisanal fishing, recreational fishing and tourism) in a rational way, so that they do not conflict with each other or with conservation aims. Furthermore, protected areas are no longer seen as "islands" of nature surrounded by incompatible resource uses but are part of a broader regional approach to land and sea management. More than 400 species can be considered as having been probably introduced into the Mediterranean Sea; this represents 4-5\% of its known flora and fauna. Since the early 20th century, their number has more or less doubled every 20 years. As a mean, 10\% of introduced species are "invasive": they play a conspicuous role in the host ecosystems, they threaten native species of communities and/or they have negative economic consequences (e.g. on aquaculture, public health and tourism). This is one of the most worrying forms of human impact, because it usually does not decrease with distance and time: it is irreversible at human scale (as coastal development and species extinction). From this point of view, introduced species undermine in an irreversible way everything that has been done to protect biodiversity, whether through the protection of species or the protection of habitats. For example, there would no longer be any point in setting up MPAs if it were merely to protect uniform meadows of introduced species, e.g. Caulerpa taxifolia, C. racemosa, Acrothamnion preissii and/or Womersleyella setacea. As far as the economic impact is concerned, it may be greater than the ecological one. This has been largely ignored in the Mediterranean countries, probably because the cost is "externalised", in such a way that those who pay are generally unaware of doing so. By undermining the policies for the conservation of species and habitats on the one hand and economic activities on the other, invasive species change the rules of the game and turn upside down the complex equilibrium that is the cornerstone of strategies of sustainable development. Frontiers, whether administrative (MPAs) or political (countries), do not exist for invasive species. The problem can thus only be dealt with at international level. It can only be understood if the full range of aims and resource uses is taken into account: it is thus par excellence a problem of sustainable development. Many international conventions (e.g. the Bonn Convention, Bern Convention, Barcelona Convention, Convention on Biological Diversity, Montego Bay Convention) recommend that countries that have ratified them should take measures to avoid the introduction of species and, if introductions should occur, to attempt to limit their spread and their impact. All Mediterranean countries have ratified at least one of these international conventions, in some cases more than 20 years ago. Nevertheless, most of them have not yet drafted a single text of law to apply the recommendations that they make. With regard to national legislation aimed at preventing and combating the introduction of species in the marine environment, most of the Mediterranean countries would thus appear to be in a total juridical vacuum (legislation levels 0 or 1), in contrast to the countries of Northern Europe and above all the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia (legislation levels 2, 3 and 4). Possible explanations for this inefficiency on the part of the technocratic administrative structures (i.e. the civil servants at the ministries of the environment) are discussed. Whatever the case may be, these attitudes, whether they are deliberate or stem from a certain amateurishness, incompetence or irresponsibility, raise a real problem in terms of democratic procedures: in states subject to the rule of law, can it be considered normal that international conventions, signed and ratified by elected officials, that a law voted by elected members of parliament, be flouted by non-elected civil servants? Introduced species are one of the major environmental problems of the 21st century, at planetary scale. Through their impact on species and habitats and on resource uses and the economy, they seriously undermine strategies of sustainable development. This fact should lead decision makers and politicians to feel more concerned by this problem},

This is the quest of General Systems Theory. It does not seek, of course, to establish a single, self-contained ``general theory of practically everything'' which will replace all the special theories of particular disciplines. Such a theory would be almost without content, for we always pay for generality by sacrificing content, and all we can say about practically everything is almost nothing. Somewhere however between the specific that has no meaning and the general that has no content there must be, for each purpose and at each level of abstraction, an optimum degree of generality. It is the contention of the General Systems Theorists that this optimum degree of generality in theory is not always reached by the particular sciences.},

  abstract = {The interplay of anthropogenic effects presents significant challenges to modelling and managing marine resources. The increasing awareness of the complexity of the interaction of human impacts has led to a demand for end-to-end (E2E) models that attempt to include all major processes in a single framework. These whole-of-system models are potentially very useful as numerical laboratories to explore the potential spectrum of responses from the interplay of anthropogenic effects. However, despite their limitations and early stage of development, the output of E2E models is under increasing social pressure to provide ``simple'' answers to highly complex problems. Here, we suggest some approaches that can be included in E2E models for considering the potential effects of complex interactions on community and ecosystem services. We show how assumptions and parameterizations made in existing E2E models can be altered to allow processes to shift with the dynamic response to both natural and human drivers. Alternative ways for interpreting complex model output, non-linearity, handling uncertainty, and how to include multispecies interaction effects within a framework of ecosystem-based management are suggested. We point out parts of the marine system that have been neglected in model development, but now should be included to understand interaction effects from multiple anthropogenic stressors. The E2E model framework also needs to be further expanded from an often-skewed focus on ecological systems to a more even-handed treatment of socio-ecological systems, including cultural aspects. Future progress in E2E models will require an interdisciplinary framework involving both qualitative and quantitative approaches, closer cooperation between empiricists and modellers, and the development of consistent terminology.},

We investigated the effects of multiple facets of biodiversity \textendash{} species richness and composition of the community, and intraspecific diversity in two key species \textendash{} on both production and resistance of experimentally-assembled biological soil crusts (biocrusts). We found that productivity was most strongly influenced by community composition (variation in the presence and relative proportions of community members), and weakly positively influenced by species richness. Intraspecific diversity, encompassing both the richness and composition of clones, had a neutral effect on community productivity within one focal species (Syntrichia caninervis), but a moderately negative effect on productivity within the other focal species (S. ruralis). Resistance was also most strongly influenced by community composition, although different sets of species contributed most to resistance and production. Resistance was not affected by either species richness or intraspecific diversity in either focal species. Our findings supported our general expectation that community-level facets of biodiversity would be more influential than intraspecific diversity within a species because trait variability among species is usually greater than that within. These results also indicated that although species richness is often thought to strongly affect both productivity and resistance, the presence, absence and relative abundance of particular species may be more influential to both. Simultaneous manipulation of multiple facets of biodiversity in experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the variety of ways in which biodiversity may regulate ecological systems.},

Overlap in the distributions of different drivers have important implications for biodiversity change attribution and the potential for interactive effects. However, the spatial relationships among different drivers and whether they differ between the terrestrial and marine realm has yet to be examined. 2. We compiled global gridded datasets on climate change, land-use, resource ex ploitation, pollution, alien species potential and human population density. We used multivariate statistics to examine the spatial relationships among the drivers and to characterize the typical combinations of drivers experienced by different regions of the world. 3. We found stronger positive correlations among drivers in the terrestrial than in the marine realm, leading to areas with high intensities of multiple drivers on land. Climate change tended to be negatively correlated with other drivers in the terrestrial realm (e.g. in the tundra and boreal forest with high climate change but low human use and pollution), whereas the opposite was true in the marine realm (e.g. in the Indo-Pacific with high climate change and high fishing). 4. We show that different regions of the world can be defined by Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs), distinguished by different sets of drivers with varying intensities.

The marine biota will encounter a complex shifting matrix of simultaneous environmental changes - including temperature, pH/pCO2, nutrients, light, and oxygen - which will be further compounded by concurrent regional and local anthropogenic impacts, such as altered freshwater runoff regimes or biomass harvesting. We are only beginning to grasp the complexity of these interactive changes on ocean biota. To understand the pronounced and/or nonlinear effects of cumulative environmental stresses on organismal fitness and ecosystem functioning, the marine global-change research community can profit from the large body of existing evidence from freshwater lakes or polluted aquatic systems. We explore how the complex environmental changes will affect the biota from primary producers to higher trophic levels in both nearshore and open ocean waters, and conclude by proposing new approaches to address the formidable challenges of this research field.

Many of these oceanic properties are being altered by climate change and other anthropogenic pressures. Hence, identifying the influences of multifaceted ocean change, from local to global scales, is a complex task. To guide policy-making and make projections of the future of the marine biosphere, it is essential to understand biological responses at physiological, evolutionary and ecological levels. Here, we contrast and compare different approaches to multiple driver experiments that aim to elucidate biological responses to a complex matrix of ocean global change. We present the benefits and the challenges of each approach with a focus on marine research, and guidelines to navigate through these different categories to help identify strategies that might best address research questions in fundamental physiology, experimental evolutionary biology and community ecology. Our review reveals that the field of multiple driver research is being pulled in complementary directions: the need for reductionist approaches to obtain process-oriented, mechanistic understanding and a requirement to quantify responses to projected future scenarios of ocean change. We conclude the review with recommendations on how best to align different experimental approaches to contribute fundamental information needed for science-based policy formulation.},

  abstract = {Aquatic environments are often contaminated with complex mixtures of chemicals that may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. This contamination cannot be addressed with target analysis alone but tools are required to reduce this complexity and identify those chemicals that might cause adverse effects. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) is designed to meet this challenge and faces increasing interest in water and sediment quality monitoring. Thus, the present paper summarizes current experience with the EDA approach and the tools required, and provides practical advice on their application. The paper highlights the need for proper problem formulation and gives general advice for study design. As the EDA approach is directed by toxicity, basic principles for the selection of bioassays are given as well as a comprehensive compilation of appropriate assays, including their strengths and weaknesses. A specific focus is given to strategies for sampling, extraction and bioassay dosing since they strongly impact prioritization of toxicants in EDA. Reduction of sample complexity mainly relies on fractionation procedures, which are discussed in this paper, including quality assurance and quality control. Automated combinations of fractionation, biotesting and chemical analysis using so-called hyphenated tools can enhance the throughput and might reduce the risk of artifacts in laboratory work. The key to determining the chemical structures causing effects is analytical toxicant identification. The latest approaches, tools, software and databases for target-, suspect and non-target screening as well as unknown identification are discussed together with analytical and toxicological confirmation approaches. A better understanding of optimal use and combination of EDA tools will help to design efficient and successful toxicant identification studies in the context of quality monitoring in multiply stressed environments.},

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) and its daughter directives are the major body of legislation for the protection and sustainable use of European freshwater resources. The practical implementation of the WFD with regard to chemical pollution has faced some challenges. In support of the upcoming WFD review in 2019 the research project SOLUTIONS and the European monitoring network NORMAN has analyzed these challenges, evaluated the state-of-the-art of the science and suggested possible solutions. We give 10 recommendations to improve monitoring and to strengthen comprehensive prioritization, to foster consistent assessment and to support solution-oriented management of surface waters. The integration of effect-based tools, the application of passive sampling for bioaccumulative chemicals and an integrated strategy for prioritization of contaminants, accounting for knowledge gaps, are seen as important approaches to advance monitoring. Including all relevant chemical contaminants in more holistic ``chemical status'' assessment, using effect-based trigger values to address priority mixtures of chemicals, to better consider historical burdens accumulated in sediments and to use models to fill data gaps are recommended for a consistent assessment of contamination. Solution-oriented management should apply a tiered approach in investigative monitoring to identify toxicity drivers, strengthen consistent legislative frameworks and apply solutions-oriented approaches that explore risk reduction scenarios before and along with risk assessment.},

The theory is presented in detail for a single, monomorphic, asexually reproducing population. We explain the necessary terminology to understand the basic arguments in models based on adaptive dynamics, including invasion fitness, the selection gradient, pairwise invasibility plots (PIP), evolutionarily singular strategies, and the canonical equation. The presentation is supported with a worked-out example of evolution of arrival times in migratory birds. We show how the adaptive dynamics methodology can be extended to study evolution in polymorphic populations using trait evolution plots (TEPs).

Toxicants have both sub-lethal and lethal effects on aquatic biota, influencing organism fitness and community composition. However, toxicant effects within ecosystems may be altered by interactions with abiotic and biotic ecosystem components, including biological interactions. Collectively, this generates the potential for toxicant sensitivity to be highly context dependent , with significantly different outcomes in ecosystems than laboratory toxicity tests predict. We experimentally manipulated stream macro-invertebrate communities in 32 mesocosms to examine how communities from a low-salinity site were influenced by interactions with those from a high-salinity site along a gradient of salinity. Relative to those from the low-salinity site, organisms from the high-salinity site were expected to have greater tolerance and fitness at higher salinities. This created the potential for both salinity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions to influence communities. We found that community composition was influenced by both direct toxicity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions. Taxon and context-dependent responses included: (i) direct toxicity effects, irrespective of biotic interactions; (ii) effects that were owing to the addition of tolerant taxa, irrespective of salinity; (iii) toxicity dependent on sensitive-tolerant taxa interactions; and (iv) toxic effects that were increased by interactions. Our results reinforce that ecological processes require consideration when examining toxicant effects within ecosystems.

While marine viruses were first described by Spencer (1955), they were largely ignored for three decades because of the relatively low abundances inferred using culturebased assays. However, since Bergh et al. (1989) recognized their numeric importance, they have been considered at least as abundant as marine microbes, and scientists have been characterizing them and trying to determine the extent of marine viral diversity. Extensive efforts have focused on understanding the role of viruses in horizontal gene transfer and microbial mortality, and on the consequent impacts on microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure. Here, we review advances in understanding viral diversity and genome evolution, and discuss potentially fruitful areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, marine virology has progressed from a curiosity to an intensely studied topic of critical importance to oceanography. At concentrations of approximately 10 million viruses per milliliter of surface seawater, viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans. The majority of these viruses are phages (viruses that infect bacteria). Through lysing their bacterial hosts, marine phages control bacterial abundance, affect community composition, and impact global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, phages influence their hosts through selection for resistance, horizontal gene transfer, and manipulation of bacterial metabolism. Recent work has also demonstrated that marine phages are extremely diverse and can carry a variety of auxiliary metabolic genes encoding critical ecological functions. This review is structured as a scientific "truth or dare," revealing several well-established "truths" about marine viruses and presenting a few "dares" for the research community to undertake in future studies.},

By growing a model photosynthetic microbe in environments containing between one and eight different drivers, including changes in CO 2, temperature, and pH, in different combinations, we show that the number as well as the identities of drivers explain shifts in population growth rates. This is because the biotic response to multiple environmental drivers depends on the response to the single dominant driver, and the chance of a driver of large effect being present increases with the number of drivers. Interactions between drivers slightly counteract the expected drop in growth. Our results demonstrate that population growth declines in a predictable way with the number of environmental drivers, and provide an empirically supported model for scaling up from studies on organismal responses to single drivers to predict responses to large numbers of environmental drivers.},

We analyzed this biological noise on a data set of 596 simultaneous absorption and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment measurements acquired within the surface layer (first optical depth) from various regions of the world's oceans. We observed systematic deviations from the average relationships for some oceanic areas and also seasonally within given areas. Using the detailed HPLC measurements, the influences of pigment composition and package effect (the two main sources of variability in algal absorption for a given chlorophyll a concentration) were explicitly separated for each sample. It was found that while the pigment composition experiences large variations, even within a restricted chlorophyll range, it is often not (at least within the first optical depth) the dominant source of the biological noise. Instead, these deviations mostly result from variability in the pigment packaging effect (for a given chlorophyll a concentration) due to variations in algal community size structure. This conclusion is fully confirmed by an independent approach, which consists of estimating a "size index" of algal populations from the relative concentrations of taxonomic pigments.

Specialized interactors, including 'cryptic specialists' with diverse but nonredundant partner assemblages, incur elevated risk. Risk is also higher for species that cannot either evolve new traits following partner loss or obtain novel partners in communities reorganizing under changing environmental conditions. Partner loss occurs alongside other anthropogenic impacts; multiple stressors can circumvent ecological buffers, enhancing secondary extinction risk. Stressors can also offset each other, reducing secondary extinction risk, a hitherto unappreciated phenomenon. This synthesis suggests improved conservation planning tactics and critical directions for research on secondary extinctions.},

Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A manipulative field experiment was run to test whether doses of two stressors (Copper and Biocide) varied in their effects on marine epifauna and ecosystem functioning depending on their sequence, timing and delay before sampling. Our key finding was that time-lags between stressors led to longer-lasting effects. We also found that the sequential order of two stressors influenced effects on measures of ecosystem-level processes: for community respiration (CR) the metal-first sequence of stressors had a negative effect; for clearance rates the biocide-first sequence had the greater effect. Effects of stressors delivered simultaneously on CR and clearance rates were short-lived. Intra-individual effects on cellular viability did not correspond with effects on ecosystem-level variables. Results show that current frameworks for understanding and managing the effects of multiple stressors can be improved by incorporating temporal variation in both cause and effect.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

Data were compared to a study carried out in 1992 at the same location. Light availability and temperature were the key factors for the timing of the diatom spring bloom. Specific algal cell lysis rates during the diatom bloom were always \textexclamdown 0.1/d. Due to sinking of the diatoms no effect of the difference in bloom magnitude between the 2 years on the pelagic microbial food web was detected. A high onset level of nitrate (55 mu M) resulted in a dense bloom of the colonial Phaeocystis, with maximum cell numbers of 1.8 x 10 super(8) cells /l. During the development of the bloom, the pH of the seawater increased from 7.9 to 8.7. The bloom of Phaeocystis declined through cell lysis (up to 0.3/d). Due to the enhanced biomass of Phaeocystis the amounts of released algal cellular carbon were high (up to 400 mu g C/l/d). Differences in Phaeocystis bloom magnitude were, as a consequence of algal cell lysis, reflected in bacterial production (up to 90 mu g C/l/d in 1993) and grazing activity of members of the microbial food web. The elevated importance of the microbial food web resulted in a high standing stock of microzooplankton (850 mu g C/l) and accumulation of regenerated inorganic nutrients. Calculations on both carbon and nitrogen budgets indicate that most of the Phaeocystis bloom was mineralized within the water column.},

The number of existing species is vastly higher than the number described, even in the macroscopically visible taxa, and biogeographical syntheses are largely lacking. A major effort in taxonomy and the training of a new generation of systematists is imperative. This effort has to e focussed on the groups of soil organisms that, to the best of our knowledge, play key roles in ecosystem functioning. To identify such groups, spheres of influence (SO1) of soil biota - such as the root biota, the shredders of organic matter and the soil bioturbators - are recognized that presumably control ecosystem processes, for example, through interactions with plants. Within those SO1, functional groups of soil organisms are recognized. Research questions of the highest urgency are the assignment of species to functional groups and determining the redundancy of species within functional groups. These priorities follow from the need to address the extent of any loss of functioning in soils, associated with intensive agriculture, forest disturbance, pollution of the environment, and global environmental change. The soil biota considered at present to be most at risk are species-poor functional groups among macrofaunal shredders of organic matter, bioturbators of soil, specialized bacteria like nitrifiers and nitrogen fixers, and fungiforming mycorrhizas. An experimental approach in addressing these research priorities is needed, using long-term and large-scale field experiments and modern methods of geostatistics and geographic information systems.},

  abstract = {The impact of Phaeocystis globosa population decline on the microbial community was studied during a mesocosm experiment, with irradiance regime and inorganic N:P ratios (4, 16, and 44) as controlling factors. Heterotrophic bacterial activity was closely related to enhanced (viral) lysis rates of P. globosa cells and disintegration of the colonies. Up to 85\% of the bacterial C demand could be supplied by P. globosa-specific cellular C release. The bacterial populations with high DNA content became dominant (\textquestiondown 70\% of total). The bacterial community showed a rapid shift in composition to take advantage of the changing conditions during the demise of the P. globosa bloom. Members of the Alphaproteobacteria and the Bacteroidetes group emerged directly upon bloom decay. Multidimensional scaling analysis in conjunction with DGGE fingerprinting implied that clustering was more related to the availability of organic carbon (the collapse of the P. gobosa bloom) than to the nature of the phytoplankton growth-controlling nutrient. Reduced irradiance delayed the development of the P. globosa population and subsequently changes in the bacterial community composition. Disintegration of P. globosa colonies resulted in the formation of transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) and aggregates, more so under P-depletion than under N-deficient conditions. The colonial matrix transformed into big aggregates under P-depleted conditions but remained largely as ghost colonies under N-depleted conditions. In the mesocosm with initial nitrogen and phosphorus supplied in the Redfield ratio, features intermediate to conditions with either N- or P-depletion were observed. It was hypothesized that TEP affected microbial population dynamics directly through bacterial colonization and indirectly through scavenging of predators and viruses. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology, with the so-called algal bloom forming species being able to occur in high abundance. Many of the algal viruses in culture infect bloom- forming algal hosts, probably as a result of the extra effort put into studying algal blooms for socio-political and economical reasons, and the high abundance of host cells. In the following review, a synopsis of the available information on viruses infecting bloom-forming algal species will be provided. It will describe the discovery, characteristics and molecular biology of the algal bloom viruses.

The study area was characterized by a phytoplankton bloom above the Kerguelen Plateau and the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters surrounding it. During the Kerguelen Ocean and Plateau compared Study (KEOPS), viral abundance was relatively high (1-19??107 mL-1) as compared to the few other studies in the Southern Ocean, significantly correlating with depth and system productivity. Viral abundance showed a strong positive relationship with the numerically dominant bacterial hosts, which in turn were correlated to phytoplankton biomass. In total, 13 different viral genome sizes were detected, with the lower-sized genomes 34 and 68 kb dominating at all stations. The viral community at the low chlorophyll C-transect grouped apart from the more productive transects A and B. Potential algal viruses were recorded for all stations, but only at very low intensities. Virally induced lysis of the smaller-sized (\textexclamdown 10 ??m) phytoplankton was a minor loss factor as compared to microzooplankton grazing (up to 6\% and 45\% of total \textexclamdown 30 ??m algal standing stock per day, respectively). Grazing was phytoplankton population-specific, but was in all cases able to keep the standing stock of the small-sized phytoplankton low (net growth rates between -0.2 and 0.2 d-1).

They find that one invasive species will likely perform better, whereas the other will do worse in areas that are currently occupied. Forecasting the distribution and performance of invasive species under a changing climate comes with particular challenges. Invasive species have not had time to colonize all favorable habitats available in the nonnative range. This nonequilibrium situation is problematic for correlative species distribution models, which may then use incomplete occurrences in the nonnative range as inputs for predicting suitable climatic conditions. However, predictions can be improved by using occurrence data from the native range (4). A more concerning challenge is that invasives may be able to establish in environmental conditions the species has not encountered in the native range (4{$\Downarrow\Downarrow$}\textendash 7), even if those conditions occur but are unoccupied in the native range (6).

Disentangling these patterns of variation is crucial to understanding intraplant variation, which sometimes is directly attributed to competition for resources with developing fruits. The dichasial cymes of Silene acutifolia were experimentally manipulated in the field to analyze whether the declines in petal size, ovule number, fruit set, and seed/ovule ratio along the inflorescence are constrained by ontogenetic development or are phenotypically plastic in response to environmental changes. At the same time, the level of pollen deficit was measured on different positions of the dichasia. The results showed clearly that all measured variables were more influenced by architecture than by resource competition with developing fruits; the removal of central (basal) and primary lateral flowers in the dichasia did not increase either the measures of floral characters or fecundity. On the other hand, although most of the decline in fecundity was due to architectural effects, there was also a pollen limitation, dependent to some degree on inflorescence position, which was probably due to lower pollen availability in the population when secondary flowers are in the female phase.},

Our analyses revealed increasing water clarity and declines in phytoplankton, native invertebrates, and prey fish since 1998 in at least three of the five lakes. Evidence for bottom-up regulation was strongest in Lake Huron, although each lake provided support in at least one pair of trophic levels. Evidence for top-down regulation was rare. Although nonindigenous dreissenid mussels probably have large impacts on nutrient cycling and phytoplankton, their effects on higher trophic levels remain uncertain.

Marine reserves could resist non-native species due to enhanced native diversity and biomass that heightens biotic resistance. Or non-native species could be enhanced by reserves by at least three mechanisms, including protection from harvesting, increased fishing pressure outside reserves facilitating invasions at a regional scale and increasing the exposure of reserves to more potential invaders, and increased propagule pressure from human visitation. We exhaustively searched the literature and found 13 cases that contained quantitative data on non-native species inside and outside marine reserves. In no cases did reserves resist non-native species. Of the seven cases where reserves were established prior to the arrival of the non-native species, five had no effect on the non-native species and two enhanced non-native species. Of the six cases where reserves were established in areas that had pre-existing non-native species, two had no effect on the non-native species and four enhanced the non-native species. These results suggest that while non-native species do equally well or better within marine reserves, too few data are currently available to draw broad, general conclusions regarding the effects of marine reserves on non-native species. Management plans for marine reserves rarely include guidelines for preventing or managing non-native species.

From 83\% to 97\% of the species living on the planet went extinct during this relatively short interval of geological time that defines the major geological boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras. The cause and resulting sequence of events that led to this extinction have puzzled geologists for years. The new stratigraphic section in Utah provided a framework for reconstruction of the chemistry that was in the ocean during the mass extinction. Geochemical analysis of the section demonstrates, moving across the boundary from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic, a significant drop in carbonate and total organic carbon, and a delayed occurrence of pyrite. Carbon isotope ratios ({$\delta$} 13 C) show a negative excursion in carbonate with ratios dropping from 2.59\textperthousand{} to -3.63\textperthousand. Elevated mercury is present at the boundary with a 4-fold increase from background levels. The boundary layer also has elevated zinc, lead, strontium, and nickel, but not at high enough levels to indicate a volcanic ash source. There is no evidence in concentrations of siderophile and chalcophile elements for an extraterrestrial impact. The stratigraphic section in Utah supports the theory of a massive release of carbon dioxide, resulting in the acidification of the oceans. High levels of mercury, as well as elevated levels of zinc and lead, implicate a coal source triggered by the contemporary Siberian Traps sill complex. The delay of enriched sulfur and barium content in the stratigraphic record indicates an anoxic ocean and upwelling of methane hydrates from depth. Further study of this stratigraphic section will aid our understanding of the global impact these catastrophic events had on life.}

As a result, we predict that ecosystems become progressively thinner\textemdash that is, they have progressively less functional redundancy\textemdash as broadly inflicted stressors become progressively more intense. This may negatively affect the temporal stability of ecosystem functions, but it also buffers ecosystem productivity against stress by favoring species less sensitive to the stressors. Our main result follows from the weak limiting similarity principle: species with more similar ecological niches compete more strongly, and their coexistence can be upset by smaller perturbations. We show that stressors can cause indirect competitive exclusions at much lower stressor intensity than needed to directly cause species extinction, consistent with the finding of empirical studies that species interactions are often the proximal drivers of local extinctions. The excluded species are more sensitive to the stressor relative to their ecologically similar competitors. Moreover, broadly inflicted stressors may cause hydra effects\textemdash where higher stressor intensity results in higher abundance for a species with lower sensitivity to the stressor than its competitors. Correlations between stressor impacts and ecological niches reduce the potential for indirect competitive exclusions, but they consequently also reduce the buffering effect of ecosystem thinning on ecosystem productivity. Our findings suggest that ecosystems experiencing stress may continue to provision ecosystem services but lose functional redundancy and stability.},

Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

  abstract = {A key challenge in ecology is to understand how nutrients and light affect the biodiversity and community structure of phytoplankton and plant communities. According to resource competition models, ratios of limiting nutrients are major determinants of species composition. At high nutrient levels, however, species interactions may shift to competition for light, which might make nutrient ratios less relevant. The ``nutrient-load hypothesis'' merges these two perspectives, by extending the classic model of competition for two nutrients to include competition for light. Here, we test five key predictions of the nutrient-load hypothesis using multispecies competition experiments. A marine phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea was inoculated in laboratory chemostats provided with different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to induce either single resource limitation or co-limitation of N, P, and light. Four of the five predictions were validated by the experiments. In particular, different resource limitations favored the dominance of different species. Increasing nutrient loads caused changes in phytoplankton species composition, even if the N:P ratio of the nutrient loads remained constant, by shifting the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light. In all treatments, small species became dominant whereas larger species were competitively excluded, supporting the common view that small cell size provides a competitive advantage under resource-limited conditions. Contrary to expectation, all treatments led to coexistence of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae, resulting in a higher diversity of species than predicted by theory. Because the coexisting species comprised three phyla with different photosynthetic pigments, we speculate that niche differentiation in the light spectrum might play a role. Our results show that mechanistic resource competition models that integrate nutrient-based and light-based approaches provide an important step forward to understand and predict how changing nutrient loads affect community composition.},

Functional Ecology \textcopyright{} 2017 British Ecological Society Trait-based models of ecological communities typically assume intraspecific variation in functional traits is not important, although such variation can change species trait rankings along gradients in resources and environmental conditions, and thus influence community structure and function. We examined the degree of intraspecific relative to interspecific variation, and reaction norms of 11 functional traits for 57 forest understorey plant species, including: intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), {$\Delta$} 15 N, five leaf traits, two stem traits and two root traits along gradients in light, nitrogen, moisture and understorey cover. Our results indicate that interspecific trait variation exceeded intraspecific variation by at least 50\% for most, but not all traits. Intraspecific variation in {$\Delta$} 15 N, iWUE, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and root traits was high (47\textendash 70\%) compared with most leaf traits and stem traits (13\textendash 38\%). {$\Delta$} 15 N varied primarily along gradients in abiotic conditions, while light and understorey cover were relatively less important. Intrinsic water-use efficiency was related primarily to light transmission, reflecting increases in photosynthesis relative to stomatal conductance. Leaf traits varied mainly as a function of light availability, with some reaction norms depending on understorey cover. Plant height increased with understorey cover, while stem-specific density was related primarily to light. Resources, environmental conditions and understorey cover did not contribute strongly to the observed variation in root traits. Gradients in resources, environmental conditions and competition all appear to control intraspecific variability in most traits to some extent. However, our results suggest that species cross-over (i.e. trait rank reversals) along the gradients measured here are generally not a concern. Intraspecific variability in understorey plant species traits can be considerable. However, trait data collected under a narrow range of environmental conditions appears sufficient to establish species rankings and scale between community and ecosystem levels using trait-based models. Investigators may therefore focus on obtaining a sufficient sample size within a single set of conditions rather than characterizing trait variation across entire gradients to optimize sampling efforts.

Although current regulatory efforts focus on monitoring and assessing a few legacy chemicals, many more anthropogenic chemicals are and will become detected in aquatic resources as a result of progress in analytical techniques. Assessing this type of exposure information based on available standard approaches from prospective risk assessment for single chemicals inevitably leads to indication of risk in most surface water bodies. As an alternative to generic assessment approaches, effect-based monitoring approaches are suggested. This offers the advantage of reducing uncertainties of effect extrapolation and additionally accounts for mixture effects. To become a credible complement to chemical monitoring information, however, a better understanding of the capabilities and gaps of available effect-based tools is needed. The authors therefore undertook to 1) compile organic contaminants detected in freshwater monitoring studies, 2) provide a synopsis of the mode of action knowledge available for the detected compounds, 3) perform a hazard ranking to identify priority mixtures, and 4) reflect on the challenges to make bioassays fit for effect-based monitoring. The present Focus article shows that chemical occurrence in European freshwaters seems to be highly variable in composition and relative abundancies. Further, although the present mode of action knowledge remains limited, the authors already see the need for batteries of effect-based tools if a more comprehensive coverage of prevailing effect qualities for mixtures is to be targeted. Finally, they suggest a list of organic compounds that could serve as a reference list for effect-based tool validation studies.

About 70 \% of the presently known scleractinian cold-water corals are expected to be exposed to corrosive waters by the end of this century due to ocean acidification. At the same time, the corals will experience a steady warming of their environment. Studies on the sensitivity of cold-water corals to climate change mainly concentrated on single stressors in short-term incubation approaches, thus not accounting for possible long-term acclimatisation and the interactive effects of multiple stressors. Besides, preceding studies did not test for possible compensatory effects of a change in food availability. In this study a multifactorial long-term experiment (6 months) was conducted with end-of-the-century scenarios of elevated pCO2 and temperature levels in order to examine the acclimatisation potential of the cosmopolitan cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to future climate change related threats. For the first time multiple ocean change impacts including the role of the nutritional status were tested on L. pertusa with regard to growth, `fitness', and survival. Our results show that while L. pertusa is capable of calcifying under elevated CO2 and temperature, its condition (fitness) is more strongly influenced by food availability rather than changes in seawater chemistry. Whereas growth rates increased at elevated temperature (+ 4\textdegree C), they decreased under elevated CO2 concentrations ({$\sim$} 800 \textmu atm). No difference in net growth was detected when corals were exposed to the combination of increased CO2 and temperature compared to ambient conditions. A 10-fold higher food supply stimulated growth under elevated temperature, which was not observed in the combined treatment. This indicates that increased food supply does not compensate for adverse effects of ocean acidification and underlines the importance of considering the nutritional status in studies investigating organism responses under environmental changes.},

The model describes dynamics of ecological communities on an evolutionary time-scale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to competition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil record, and to the theory of self-organized criticality.},

Synechococcus, the focus of this review, is one of the prevalent genera in the order Chroococcales, common in oceans and lakes and characterized by a coccoid unicellular or microcolony morphology. The evolution of its phycobilisomes is the key of the adaptation of this tiny photosynthetic cell to different light regimes and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Synechococcus strains are widely distributed from the equator to the poles, showing an extreme adaptability to high and low temperatures. Because of their structural plasticity and ecological adaptability, these cyanobacteria are particularly interesting in the current condition of fast climate change. Moreover, picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus genus have a potentially vast impact on global cycles thanks to their significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems. As increasing abundances are predicted for this genus worldwide, and in light of the connection between cyanobacteria and global change events, a better characterization of these organisms promises important and timely ecological insights.

  abstract = {Projections of marine biodiversity and implementation of effective actions for its maintenance in the face of current rapid global environmental change are constrained by our limited understanding of species' adaptive responses, including transgenerational plasticity, epigenetics and natural selection. This special issue presents 13 novel studies, which employ experimental and modelling approaches to (i) investigate plastic and evolutionary responses of marine species to major global change drivers; (ii) ask relevant broad eco-evolutionary questions, implementing multiple species and populations studies; (iii) show the advantages of using advanced experimental designs and tools; (iv) construct novel model organisms for marine evolution; (v) help identifying future challenges for the field; and (vi) highlight the importance of incorporating existing evolutionary theory into management solutions for the marine realm. What emerges is that at least some populations of marine species have the ability to adapt to future global change conditions. However, marine organisms' capacity for adaptation appears finite, due to evolutionary trade-offs and possible rapid losses in genetic diversity. This further corroborates the idea that acquiring an evolutionary perspective on how marine life will respond to the selective pressure of future global changes will guide us in better identifying which conservation efforts will be most needed and most effective.},

In contrast, little is known about how other major global change drivers, such as ocean acidification (OA), will shape species distributions in the future. Here, by integrating population genetics with experimental data for growth and mineralization, physiology and metabolomics, we demonstrate that the sensitivity of populations of the gastropod Littorina littorea to future OA is shaped by regional adaptation. Individuals from populations towards the edges of the natural latitudinal range in the Northeast Atlantic exhibit greater shell dissolution and the inability to upregulate their metabolism when exposed to low pH, thus appearing most sensitive to low seawater pH. Our results suggest that future levels of OA could mediate temperature-driven shifts in species distributions, thereby influencing future biogeography and the functioning of marine ecosystems.},

Although these picoplankters potentially are important food sources for heterotrophic nanoplankton, the cycling of Synechococcus biomass has not yet been well described. Two approaches recently proposed for measuring grazing pressure by heterotrophic nanoplankton (2 to 20 vm) were used to measure specific grazing rates on Synechococcus spp.: (1) the sea water dllution culture technique of Landry \& Hassett (Mar. Biol. 67: 283-288); (2) the selective inhibitor method of Fuhrrnan \& McManus (Science 224: 1257-1260). Several samples were collected at coastal and oceanic Northwest Atlantic sites and grazing estimates by the 2 methods were compared. Grazing coefficients, g (d-l), ranged from 0 to 0.35 d-' at an oceanic warm core eddy (WCE) station, but were greater (up to 0.83 d-l) at the coastal stations. At the coastal station, both methods yielded similar rates, but at the WCE station, where Synechococcus spp. abundance was low, only the selective inhibitor produced significant grazing estimates. Sample dlution may have reduced cell numbers below a grazing threshold. In such cases, the inhibitor method may provide more reliable measurements. Using the grazing coefficients from these experiments, consumption of Synechococcus biomass was compared wth production by Synechococcus populahons. At the WCE and Long lsland Sound stations, 37 to 52 \% of the Synechococcus biomass produced was consunled by grazers, whereas at the coastal Gulf of Maine station the biomass produced appeared to be balanced by the biornass consumed.},

Furthermore, we explored the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to shifts in CWM values along the gradient. Forty sampling units (5 \texttimes{} 5 m) were selected in a probabilistic way along a 1300 m elevation gradient which crossed four thermotypes (thermometric belts). Leaf traits were measured in each sampling unit. ANOVA and a trend test for monotonic changes in variance were used to assess, respectively, CWM differences and variability in both the leaf traits across thermotypes. Variance decomposition of CWM values was used to identify the role of inter- and intraspecific variation. SLA and LA responded differently along the studied gradient in terms of abundance-weighted mean values and variability: CWM of SLA showed the lowest values in the driest thermotype, while LA in the more humid one; SLA variability showed a significant increasing trend with increased water availability, while LA variability did not show any pattern. The contribution of intraspecific trait variation was significant for both the leaf traits, but higher for SLA, where negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific variation was detected. We highlight the importance of simultaneously considering measurements of both leaf traits to understand the functional response of communities in Mediterranean environments. Moreover, neglecting intraspecific variation in leaf traits, even along steep gradients with relevant species compositional changes, can result in the underestimation of the amount of trait variation in response to environmental changes.},

In this study, the potential derangement of MAPK pathways has been evaluated in human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the larynx. The expression and activity of the MAPK p38, ERK1/2p44/p42 and JNK/SAPKp46/p54 have been investigated by immunoblot analysis of tissue homogenates in 27 samples of primary laryngeal cancer and in 27 paired non-neoplastic laryngeal mucosa. On the same tissues, the activation of MAPK JNK/SAPKp46/p54 was also analyzed by an ELISA assay. The results obtained showed that both total and phosphorylated levels of JNK/SAPKp46/p54 and p38 were not different between tumor and normal samples. Conversely, while total protein levels for both ERK1p44 and ERK2p42 were not statistically different between tumor and normal samples, the analysis of the level of the activated forms of ERK1/2 showed a statistically significant decreased phosphorylation of both isoforms in the tumor samples compared to the control tissues. The rate of reduction was similar for both isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis of all the activated MAPK (p38, JNK/SAPKp46/ p54 and ERK1/2p44/p42) in both laryngeal SCC and normal mucosa demonstrated no difference of cellular localization. Activated ERK1/2p44/p42 and activated p38 demonstrated a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution whereas activated JNK/SAPKp46/p54 were localized into the cytoplasmic membrane. The decreased activity of ERK1/2p44/42 in laryngeal SCC might reflect alterations in tumor suppressing activity or might derive from the interplay among various transduction pathways.},

Factors which have brought this population to the verge of extinction have not yet been fully elucidated, but the effects of deforestation and habitat fragmentation on survival rates, as well as those of variation in rainfall, temperature, snowpack depth and snowmelt strongly suggest that marmots on the island are struggling to keep pace with environmental changes. Genetic analyses, however, seem to indicate that the Vancouver Island marmot may merely represent a melanistic population of its parental species on the mainland. Were it not for its black pelage colour, it is unlikely that it would have attracted much attention as a conservation priority. Our study uses three-dimensional coordinates of cranial landmarks to further assess phenotypic differentiation of the Vancouver Island marmot. A pattern of strong interspecific divergence and low intraspecific variation was found which is consistent with aspects of drift-driven models of speciation. However, the magnitude of shape differences relative to the putatively neutral substitutions in synonymous sites of cytochrome b is too large for being compatible with a simple neutral model. A combination of bottlenecks and selective pressures due to natural and human-induced changes in the environment may offer a parsimonious explanation for the large phenotypic differentiation observed in the species. Our study exemplifies the usefulness of a multidisciplinary approach to the study of biological diversity for a better understanding of evolutionary models and to discover aspects of diversity that may be undetected by using only a few genetic markers to characterize population divergence and uniqueness. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Cartilaginous fish are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors and environmental change because of their K-selected reproductive strategy. Accurate data from scientific surveys and landings are essential to assess conservation status and to develop robust protection and management plans. Currently available data are often incomplete or incorrect as a result of inaccurate species identifications, due to a high level of morphological stasis, especially among closely related taxa. Moreover, several diagnostic characters clearly visible in adult specimens are less evident in juveniles. Here we present results generated by the ELASMOMED Consortium, a regional network aiming to sample and DNA-barcode the Mediterranean Chondrichthyans with the ultimate goal to provide a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library. This library will support and improve the molecular taxonomy of this group and the effectiveness of management and conservation measures. We successfully bar-coded 882 individuals belonging to 42 species (17 sharks, 24 batoids and one chimaera), including four endemic and several threatened ones. Morphological misidentifications were found across most orders, further confirming the need for a comprehensive DNA barcoding library as a valuable tool for the reliable identification of specimens in support of taxonomist who are reviewing current identification keys. Despite low intraspecific variation among their barcode sequences and reduced samples size, five species showed preliminary evidence of phylogeographic structure. Overall, the ELASMOMED initiative further emphasizes the key role accurate DNA barcoding libraries play in establishing reliable diagnostic species specific features in otherwise taxonomically problematic groups for biodiversity management and conservation actions. \textcopyright{} 2017 Cariani et al.

Located in the southeastern Sonoran desert of California, it is 85 m below sea level at its lowest point. It was formed between 1905 and 1907 from heavy river flows of the Colorado River. Since its formation, it has attracted both people and wildlife, including flocks of migratory birds that have made the Salton Sea a critical stopover on the Pacific flyway. Over the past 15 years wintering populations of eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) at the Salton Sea, have experienced over 200,000 mortalities. The cause of these large die-offs remains unknown. The unique environmental conditions of the Salton Sea, including salinities from brackish freshwater at river inlets to hypersaline conditions, extreme daily summer temperatures ({$>$}38\textdegree C), and high nutrient loading from rivers and agricultural drainage favor eutrophic conditions that encourage algal blooms throughout the year. A significant component of these algal blooms are the prokaryotic group \textendash{} the Cyanophyta or blue-green algae (also called Cyanobacteria). Since many Cyanobacteria produce toxins (the cyanotoxins) it became important to evaluate their presence and to determine if they are a contributing factor in eared-grebe mortalities at the Salton Sea.},

We mathematically demonstrate that this parameter is network-specific and connects local stability and robustness, establishing a formal connection between community structure and two prime stability concepts. Importantly, this connection highlights a local stability\textendash robustness trade-off, which is stronger in mutualistic than in trophic networks. Analysis of 435 empirical networks confirmed these results. We finally show how our network-specific approach relates to the classical across-network approach found in literature.

Each of 32 fish from four spawning aggregations from the northwest Atlantic and Norway has a unique mtDNA sequence, which differs by 6-60 substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis identifies six major haplogroups that range in age from 37 to 75 KYA. The widespread haplotype identified by previous single-locus analyses at the center of a "star phylogeny" is shown to be a paraphyletic assemblage of genome lineages. The coalescent that includes all cod occurs 162 KYA. The most basal clade comprises two fish from the western Atlantic. The most recent superclade that includes all fish examined from Norway, and which includes 84\% of all fish examined, dates to 128 KYA at the Sangamon/W\"urm interglacial, when ocean depths on continental shelves would have favored transcontinental movement. The pairwise mismatch distribution dates population expansion of this superclade to the middle of the Wisconsinan/Weichsel glaciation 59 KYA, rather than to a postglacial emergence from a marine refugium 12 KYA, or to more recent historic events. We discuss alternative scenarios for the expansion and distribution of the descendants of the "codmother" in the North Atlantic. Mitochondrial phylogenomic analyses generate highly resolved trees that enable fine-scale tests of temporal hypotheses with an accuracy not possible with single-locus methods.

Stable coexistence of many species is commonly observed in natural communities. Most of these natural communities, however, are composed of species from multiple trophic and functional groups, while theory and experiments on coexistence have been focusing on functionally similar species. Here, we investigated how functional diversity affects the stability of species coexistence and productivity in multispecies communities by characterizing experimentally all pairwise species interactions in a pool of 11 species of eukaryotes (10 protists and one rotifer) belonging to three different functional groups. Species within the same functional group showed stronger competitive interactions compared to among-functional group interactions. This often led to competitive exclusion between species that had higher functional relatedness, but only at low levels of species richness. Communities with higher functional diversity resulted in increased species coexistence and community biomass production. Our experimental findings and the results of a stochastic model tailored to the experimental interaction matrix suggest the emergence of strong stabilizing forces when species from different functional groups interact in a homogeneous environment. By combining theoretical analysis with experiments we could also disentangle the relationship between species richness and functional diversity, showing that functional diversity per se is a crucial driver of productivity and stability in multispecies community.},

We analysed a unique (large) collection of phytoplankton monitoring data covering 86 coastal sites distributed over eight regions in North America and Europe, with the aim of investigating common patterns in the seasonal timing and species composition of the blooms. The spring bloom was the most common seasonal pattern across all regions, typically occurring early (February-March) at lower latitudes and later (April-May) at higher latitudes. Bloom frequency, defined as the probability of unusually high biomass, ranged from 5 to 35\% between sites and followed no consistent patterns across gradients of latitude, temperature, salinity, water depth, stratification, tidal amplitude or nutrient concentrations. Blooms were mostly dominated by a single species, typically diatoms (58\% of the blooms) and dinoflagellates (19\%). Diatom-dominated spring blooms were a common feature in most systems, although dinoflagellate spring blooms were also observed in the Baltic Sea. Blooms dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were only common in low salinity waters and occurred mostly at higher temperatures. Key bloom species across the eight regions included the diatoms Cerataulina pelagica and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus and dinoflagellates Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum cordatum. Other frequent bloom-forming taxa were diatom genera Chaetoceros, Coscinodiscus, Skeletonema, and Thalassiosira. Our meta-analysis shows that these 86 estuarine-coastal sites function as diatom-producing systems, the timing of that production varies widely, and that bloom frequency is not associated with environmental factors measured in monitoring programs. We end with a perspective on the limitations of conclusions derived from meta-analyses of phytoplankton time series, and the grand challenges remaining to understand the wide range of bloom patterns and processes that select species as bloom dominants in coastal waters.},

The acidotropic blue probe was also effective in staining food vacuoles in the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Dinophysis norvegica. We observed that 75\% of the D. norvegica population in the aphotic zone possessed food vacuoles. Overall, in cells without food vacuoles, blue fluorescence was as low as in cells that were kept probe free. Blue fluorescence in O. marina cells with food vacuoles was 6-fold higher than in those without food vacuoles (20 {$\pm$} 4 and 3 {$\pm$} 0 relative blue fluorescence cell\textendash 1, respectively), while in D. norvegica cells were 4.5-fold brighter than the ones without food vacuoles (291 {$\pm$} 155 and 64 {$\pm$} 23 relative blue fluorescence cell\textendash 1, respectively).

Trait expression differs with context, with repercussions for the faunal mediation of ecosystem processes; we find increased rates of righting and burial behaviour and greater particle reworking with increasing density that are reflected in nutrient generation. However, the magnitude of effects differed within and between species, arising from site-specific environmental and morphological differences. Our results indicate that traits and processes influencing change in ecosystem functioning are products of both prevailing and historic conditions that cannot be constrained within typologies. Trait-based study must incorporate context-dependent variation, including intraspecific differences from individual to ecosystem scales, to avoid jeopardizing projections of ecosystem functioning and service delivery.},

  abstract = {How anthropogenic stressors affect biodiversity is a central question in a changing world. Subterranean ecosystems and their biodiversity are particularly vulnerable to change, yet, these species are frequently neglected in analyses of global biodiversity and assessments of ecological status and risk. Are these hidden species affected by anthropogenic stressors? Do they survive outside of the current thermal limits of their ecosystems? These and other important questions can be addressed with ecotoxicological testing, relating contaminants and temperature resistance of species with measured environmental concentrations and climatic data. Ecotoxicological knowledge specific to subterranean ecosystems is crucial for establishing thresholds for their protection, but such data are both scarce and scattered. Here, we review the existing ecotoxicological studies of these impacts to subterranean-adapted species. An effort that includes 167 measured endpoints and presents a database containing experimentally derived species' tolerance data for 28 contaminants and temperature, for 46 terrestrial and groundwater species, including fungi and animals. The lack of standard data among the studies is currently the major impediment to evaluate how stressors affect subterranean-adapted species and how differently they respond from their relatives at surface. Improving understanding of ecotoxicological effects on subterranean-adapted species will require extensive analysis of physiological responses to a wide range of untested stressors, standardization of testing protocols and evaluation of exposures under realistic scenarios.},

  abstract = {Abstract: While plant community theory tends to emphasize the importance of abiotic heterogeneity along niche axes, much empirical work seeks to characterize the influence of the absolute magnitude of key abiotic variables on diversity. Both magnitude (as reflected, e.g., by a mean) and heterogeneity (variance) in abiotic conditions likely contribute to biodiversity patterns in plant communities, but given the large number of putative abiotic drivers and the fact that each may vary at different spatiotemporal scales, the challenge of linking observed biotic patterns with the underlying environment remains acute. Using monitoring data from a natural resource agency, we compared how well statistical models of the mean, heterogeneity, and both the mean and heterogeneity combined of 17 abiotic factor variables explained patterns of forb species richness in Northeast Ohio, USA. We performed our analyses at two spatial scales, repeated in spring and summer across four forest types. Although all models explained a great deal of the variance in species richness, models including both the mean and heterogeneity of different abiotic factors together outperformed models including either the mean or the heterogeneity of abiotic factors alone. Variability in forb species richness was mostly due to changes in mean calcium levels regardless of forest type. After accounting for forest type, we were able to attribute variation in forb species richness to changes in the heterogeneity of different abiotic factors as well. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms act simultaneously according to different aspects of the abiotic environment to structure forb communities, and this underscores the importance of considering both the magnitude of and heterogeneity in multiple abiotic factors when looking for links between the abiotic environment and plant community patterns. Finally, we identify novel patterns across spatial scales, forest types, and seasons that can guide future research in this vein.

  abstract = {Aim: Invasion ecology includes many hypotheses. Empirical evidence suggests that most of these can explain the success of some invaders to some degree in some circumstances. If they all are correct, what does this tell us about invasion? We illustrate the major themes in invasion ecology, and provide an overarching framework that helps organize research and foster links among subfields of invasion ecology and ecology more generally. Location: Global. Methods: We review and synthesize 29 leading hypotheses in plant invasion ecology. Structured around propagule pressure (P), abiotic characteristics (A) and biotic characteristics (B), with the additional influence of humans (H) on P, A and B (hereon PAB), we show how these hypotheses fit into one paradigm. P is based on the size and frequency of introductions, A incorporates ecosystem invasibility based on physical conditions, and B includes the characteristics of invading species (invasiveness), the recipient community and their interactions. Having justified the PAB framework, we propose a way in which invasion research could progress. Results: By highlighting the common ground among hypotheses, we show that invasion ecology is encumbered by theoretical redundancy that can be removed through integration. Using both holistic and incremental approaches, we show how the PAB framework can guide research and quantify the relative importance of different invasion mechanisms. Main conclusions: If the prime aim is to identify the main cause of invasion success, we contend that a top-down approach that focuses on PAB maximizes research efficiency. This approach identifies the most influential factors first, and subsequently narrows the number of potential causal mechanisms. By viewing invasion as a multifaceted process that can be partitioned into major drivers and broken down into a series of sequential steps, invasion theory can be rigorously tested, understanding improved and effective weed management techniques identified. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

Oxygen uptake rates over coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds in the Tr\ae na Coral Field (Norway) were 9\textendash 20 times higher than those of the surrounding soft sediments. These high respiration rates indicate strong organic matter consumption, and hence suggest a local focusing onto these ecosystems of the downward flux of organic matter that is exported from the surface ocean. Overall, our results show that coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds are hotspots of carbon processing in the food-limited deep ocean, and that these deep-sea ecosystems play a more prominent role in marine biogeochemical cycles than previously recognized.},

Understanding the factors that influence the resilience of species is thus a key component of evolutionary biology, but it is also of prime importance in a context of climate change and for conservation in general. We explored the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the timing of the oldest diversification event in over 600 vertebrate species distributed worldwide. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to show that color polymorphism, latitude and reproduction (the latter through its interaction with latitude) affected the timing of the oldest diversification event within a species. Results: Species from higher latitudes tended to be younger, and colour-polymorphic species were older than monomorphic species. Mode of reproduction was important also, in that the age of oviparous species decreased with latitude, whereas no pattern was apparent for viviparous species. Organisms which have already persisted for a long time may be more likely to deal with future modifications of their environment. Conclusions: Species that are colour polymorphic, viviparous, and/or live at low latitudes have exhibited resilience to past environmental changes, and hence may be better able to deal with current climate change. \textcopyright{} 2016 Cattin et al.},

Their distinct geological and ecological features allow them to support a diversity of vent communities, which are largely dependent on Bacteria and Archaea capable of anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolism. These communities play important ecological roles through chemoautotrophy, feeding and in establishing symbiotic associations. However, the occurrence and distribution of these microbes remain poorly understood, especially in deep-sea sediments. In this study, we provide for the first time a comparative survey of the sediment-associated microbial communities from these three neighbouring vent fields. Sediment samples collected in the Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike and Rainbow vent fields showed significant differences in trace-metal concentrations and associated microbiomes. The taxonomic profiles of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic representatives were assessed by rRNA gene-tag pyrosequencing, identified anaerobic methanogens and microaerobic Epsilonproteobacteria, particularly at the Menez Gwen site, suggesting sediment communities potentially enriched in sub-seafloor microbes rather than from pelagic microbial taxa. Cosmopolitan OTUs were also detected mostly at Lucky Strike and Rainbow sites and affiliated with the bacterial clades JTB255, Sh765B-TzT-29, Rhodospirillaceae and OCS155 marine group and with the archaeal Marine Group I. Some variations in the community composition along the sediment depth were revealed. Elemental contents and hydrothermal influence are suggested as being reflected in the composition of the microbial assemblages in the sediments of the three vent fields. Altogether, these findings represent valuable information for the understanding of the microbial distribution and potential ecological roles in deep-sea hydrothermal fields.},

Invasions of zebra and quagga mussels have had long-term, large-scale impacts on lake ecosystems in the USA as characterised by high abundance, broad-scale spread and effective adaption to new environmental conditions. Due to their high filtering capacity, decreases in chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have been reported in many affected lakes. 2. In 25 US lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in Chl\textendash TP relationships using Bayesian hierarchical regressions. We also examined whether changes in Chl and TP concentrations and in the Chl\textendash TP relationship differed according to lake hydromorphology, such as mean depth or mixing status (mixed versus stratified lakes). 3. Our results showed that dreissenid invasions were often, but not always, associated with subsequent TP and Chl declines. Dreissenid effects on Chl and TP may be influenced by lake thermal structure. Decreases in Chl and TP were consistently found in mixed lakes where benthic\textendash{} pelagic coupling is tight, while the effects were less predictable in stratified lakes. Within stratified lakes, Chl and TP reductions were more clearly discernible in deeper lakes with long water residence times. 4. Regression results demonstrated that a joint increase in slope and decrease in intercept and a tighter correlation of the Chl\textendash TP relationship were likely to occur in dreissenid-invaded lakes; this does not support the idea of a shift from bottom-up to top-down control of primary production. These results have important implications for management, suggesting that a relaxation of TP standards would be unwarranted. 5. Across lakes, the slope of the Chl\textendash TP relationship for mixed lakes was substantially higher than that for stratified lakes before mussel invasion, indicating an important role of light in limiting primary production. The slope differences between mixed and stratified lakes decreased in the post-invasion period, possibly because mussel filtration results in a relaxation of light limitation that is more pronounced in deeper, stratified lakes.},

Mechanisms of toxicity and tolerance to copper are not well understood. We used RNA-sequencing to investigate these mechanisms in three genetically distinct D. pulex clonal lineages with different histories of copper exposure. Upregulated genes after copper exposure were enriched with Gene Ontology (GO) categories involved in digestion, molting and growth, whereas downregulated genes after copper exposure were enriched in the metal-regulatory system, immune response and epigenetic modifications. The three D. pulex clones in our study show largely similar transcriptional patterns in response to copper, with only a total of twenty genes differentially expressed in a single clonal lineages. We also detected lower relative expression of some genes known to be important for copper tolerance, metallothionein and glutathione-S-transferase, in a sensitive lineage sampled from an uncontaminated habitat. Daphnia-specific genes (without orthologs outside the genus) and Daphnia-specific duplications (genes duplicated in the Daphnia lineage) were overrepresented in differentially expressed genes, highlighting an important role for newly emerged genes in tolerating environmental stressors. The results indicate that the D. pulex lineages tested in this study generally respond to copper stress using the same major pathways, but that the more resistant clone with previous copper exposure might be better able to regulate key genes. This finding highlights the important nuances in gene expression among clones, shaped by historical exposure and influencing copper tolerance. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated what mechanisms contribute to stable cooperative aggregation in the face of potential exploitation by less-cooperative lines using experimental microcosms We found that kin recognition modulates aggregative behavior to exclude cheaters from social interactions Long-distance kin recognition across patches modulates social structure by allowing recruitment of kin in aggregative lines and repulsion in asocial lines. Although previous studies have shown a clear benefit to social aggregation at low population densities, we found that social aggregation has very different effects at higher densities. Lower growth rates are a cost of aggregation, but also present potential benefits when restricted to kin aggregations: slow growth and crowd tolerance allow aggregations to form and permit longer persistence on ephemeral resources. Thus in highly dynamic metapopulations, kin recognition plays an important role in the formation and stability of social groups that increase persistence through cooperative consumptive restraint.},

We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

At the same time, environmental change can trigger evolutionary responses that could stabilize or destabilize ecosystem dynamics. However, we know little about how coupled ecological and evolutionary processes affect the risk of transition between alternative ecosystem states. Using shallow lakes as a model ecosystem, we investigate how trait evolution of a key species affects ecosystem resilience under environmental stress. We find that adaptive evolution of macrophytes can increase ecosystem resilience by shifting the critical threshold, which marks the transition from a clear-water state to a turbid-water state to a higher level of environmental stress. However, following the transition, adaptation to the turbid-water state can delay the ecosystem recovery back to the clear-water state. This implies that restoration could be more effective when implemented early enough after a transition occurs and before organisms adapt to the alternative state. Our findings provide new insights into how to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of regime shifts in ecosystems and highlight the need to understand ecosystem responses to environmental change in the context of coupled ecological and evolutionary processes.},

However, measuring the number and extent of protected areas only provides a unidimensional indicator of political commitment to biodiversity conservation. Data on the geographic location and spatial extent of protected areas will not provide information on a key determinant for meeting global biodiversity targets: 'effectiveness' in conserving biodiversity. Although tools are being devised to assess management effectiveness, there is no globally accepted metric. Nevertheless, the numerical, spatial and geographic attributes of protected areas can be further enhanced by investigation of the biodiversity coverage of these protected areas, using species, habitats or biogeographic classifications. This paper reviews the current global extent of protected areas in terms of geopolitical and habitat coverage, and considers their value as a global indicator of conservation action or response. The paper discusses the role of the World Database on Protected Areas and collection and quality control issues, and identifies areas for improvement, including how conservation effectiveness indicators may be included in the database to improve the value of protected areas data as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets.},

  abstract = {Analysis of smilarities (ANOSIM) has been widely used for testing hypotheses about spatial differences and temporal changes in assemblages and particularly for detecting environmental mpacts. ANOSIM generates a value of R which is scaled to lie between -1 and +l, a value of zero representing the null hypothesis. Generally, R lies between zero and + 1. Values much smaller than zero have been considered unlikely because they would indicate greater dissimilarity among replicate units within samples than occurs between samples. Nevertheless, in some habitats, frequent and large negative values of R are common. In this paper, assemblages that consistently gave negative R values when analysed using ANOSIM were examined to identify patterns of differences among replicates within and between samples to test the hypothesis that particular patterns of differences generated consistent negative R values. The hypothesised patterns were then tested by analys{$\sim$}ngs imple assemblages generated by computer simulation and examining the frequencies of R values. In natural assemblages, negative R values were found when assemblages were very patchy so that replicates were variable, but each sample had similar amounts of variability anlong replicates. Large negative values of R were particularly common when either or both samples contained an outlier, or when the assemblage being sampled had 2 different states and the replicates had sampled each of these states. Negative values of R may therefore indicate the need for stratification of the sampling design, or problems of positive correlation between the different sets of samples. When negative values occur, they should not simply be ignored as anomalies. In fact, they identify important ecological information and identify issues about the design of sampling.},

In this paper, we reviewed the primary literature to examine how carrying capacity is applied in ecology. We focused our review on ecosystem studies\textemdash studies that frame their results at the ecosystem level\textemdash published after the 1950s and highlight emerging trends of this concept. We found that while carrying capacity offers some underlying commonalities, a wide range of definitions and approaches hinders a unified framework to better understand biotic ecosystem interactions. Not surprisingly, these studies most often use K\textemdash the number of individuals that the environment ``can support'' in a given area\textemdash to define carrying capacity, despite considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in this approach. Furthermore, the studies that we reviewed spanned several levels of ecological organization: molecules to communities and up to landscapes. To add further complexity, it is not clear whether carrying capacity was intended as a dynamic concept subject to temporal variability as it was often applied in the reviewed studies. We found that carrying capacity is most often applied to studies in conservation biology, rangeland and wildlife management, aquaculture, and fisheries biology. We explore ecosystem level responses to implications of ``carrying capacity'' overshoot and discuss proposed mechanisms that govern ecosystem carrying capacity. We discuss the usefulness of the concept and end with suggestions to improve carrying capacity's general application in ecosystem studies.},

In this paper we highlight the key issues regarding biological coverage, the complexity of multiply stressed environments, and our inability to predict the biological effects under such scenarios. To address these challenges, we provide an extension of the current Environmental Risk Assessment framework. Underpinning this extension is the harnessing of environmental-genomic data, which has the capacity to provide a broader view of diversity, and to express the ramifications of multiple stressors across multiple levels of biological organisation.

Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations.

Trait-based approaches to ecological studies have developed greatly over recent decades worldwide, although several issues concerning the relationships between plant functional traits and the environment still lack sufficient empirical evaluation. To draw insights on the association between plant functional traits and direct and indirect human and natural pressures on the environmental drivers, this article summarizes the existing knowledge on this topic by reviewing the results of studies performed in Italy adopting a functional trait approach on vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. Although we recorded trait measurements for 1418 taxa, our review highlighted some major gaps in plant traits knowledge: Mediterranean ecosystems are poorly represented; traits related to belowground organs are still overlooked; traits measurements for bryophytes and lichens are lacking. Finally, intraspecific variation has been little studied at community level so far. We conclude by highlighting the need for approaches evaluating trait\textendash environment relationship at large spatial and temporal scales and the need of a more effective contribution to online databases to tie more firmly Italian researchers to international scientific networks on plant traits.},

  abstract = {We evaluated a hypothesis derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) that the ratio of microzooplankton herbivory (m) to phytoplankton growth ({$\mu$}) will arise in a warming ocean because of the different temperature dependencies of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms. Using community-level growth and grazing data from dilution experiments, generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed to describe the effects of temperature and chlorophyll on m: m. At low chlorophyll levels, m: {$\mu$} decreases with increasing temperature, whereas at high chlorophyll levels, m: {$\mu$} increases initially with temperature before reaching a peak and then declines. These complex responses of m: {$\mu$} result from mixed effects of temperature and chlorophyll on microzooplankton biomass (B z ), biomass-specific microzooplankton grazing rate (m:B z ), and phytoplankton growth rate ({$\mu$}). B z decreases with rising temperature and increases with rising chlorophyll. m:B z increases with temperature and decreases with chlorophyll. Nutrient-enriched growth rate of phytoplankton ({$\mu$}n) and m increase with increasing temperature and chlorophyll. Holding chlorophyll constant, the calculated activation energies of {$\mu$}:B z and {$\mu$}n are 0.67 6 0.05 and 0.36 6 0.05 eV, respectively, both consistent with previous MTE estimates for heterotrophs and autotrophs. Our study indicates that warming may enhance phytoplankton losses to microzooplankton herbivory in eutrophic but not in oligotrophic waters. The GAM analysis also provides important insights into underlying system relationships and reasons why community-level responses in natural systems may depart from theory based on laboratory data and individual species. \textcopyright{} 2012, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Genetic and phenotypic variations among closely related AMF isolates can significantly affect plant growth, but the genomic changes underlying this variability are unclear. To address this issue, we improved the genome assembly and gene annotation of the model strain Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198, and compared its gene content with five isolates of R. irregularis sampled in the same field. All isolates harbor striking genome variations, with large numbers of isolate-specific genes, gene family expansions, and evidence of interisolate genetic exchange. The observed variability affects all gene ontology terms and PFAM protein domains, as well as putative mycorrhiza-induced small secreted effector-like proteins and other symbiosis differentially expressed genes. High variability is also found in active transposable elements. Overall, these findings indicate a substantial divergence in the functioning capacity of isolates harvested from the same field, and thus their genetic potential for adaptation to biotic and abiotic changes. Our data also provide a first glimpse into the genome diversity that resides within natural populations of these symbionts, and open avenues for future analyses of plant\textendash AMF interactions that link AMF genome variation with plant phenotype and fitness. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have grown exponentially, emerging as a widespread tool to conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries production. Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta-analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85\textdegree{} of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea-surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4-fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2-fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.},

  abstract = {Summary The auxosporulation of Licmophora communis is allogamous and dioecious. Pairing between sessile, short-stalked cells of compatible clones is followed by meiosis and gametogenesis, to form two gametes in each game-tangium. The behavior of the gametes differs between the gametangia. In the male gametangium, the gametes detach from the frustule, round up, and migrate out of the gametangium after its dehiscence at the broader, unattached pole. In the female gametangium, both gametes remain attached to the adjacent theca over almost their whole length and do not move. Plasmo-gamy therefore occurs within the female gametangium and this is where the zygotes are formed and remain. After fertilization, the zygotes detach from the thecae of the female gametangia, contract, and become ellipsoidal, before expanding parallel to the apical axis of the gametangium. We review the types of auxosporulation in other pennate diatoms and the systems used for classifying these. Dioecy and cis-type anisogamy (in which one gametangium produces active gametes and the other produces passive gametes), as in L. communis, are probably primitive within the pennate group (although there is no information on the Asterionellopsis- Rhaphoneis clade). However, size can also be restored in various araphid pennates by allogamous sexual reproduction involving the formation of only one gamete per gametangium, or in rare cases by automixis or (apparently) vegetative enlargement.},

During the mitotic cell cycle, the two plate-shaped chloroplasts were girdle-appressed during interphase and mitosis. After cytokinesis, the chloroplasts moved onto the parental valve and remained there during the formation of the new hypovalve and until separation and re-arrangement of the sibling cells within the cell chain had been completed. Clones were almost always heterothallic and cultures of opposite mating type isolated from different localities were compatible. Meiosis I was cytokinetic and accompanied by chloroplast division. Meiosis II involved karyokinesis but not cytokinesis and preceded the rearrangement and contraction of the two gametes. Sexual reproduction involved physiological anisogamy. With one exception, gamete behaviour was clone-specific, gametes being active in clones of one mating type but passive in clones of the other mating type. Auxospore development was accompanied by deposition of a transverse and then a longitudinal perizonium. Infrequently, triploid auxospores and presumably haploid auxospores were produced. The four chloroplasts of diploid auxospores did not divide, and behaved synchronously during the two acytokinetic mitotic cycles accompanying the deposition of the initial thecae. Just before the first division of the initial cell, the chloroplasts shifted onto the valves ( two per valve). The division of the initial cell was not accompanied by chloroplast division and so the two daughter cells received two chloroplasts each. Two modes of abrupt cell size reduction were detected. One occurred during initial cell formation when part of the expanded auxospore aborted. The other pattern was more gradual and was observed in growing cultures; during successive cell divisions a frustule constriction appeared and intensified, one chloroplast split into two, and part of the protoplast aborted. A simple naming system is proposed for mating types in pennate diatoms.},

This method yields broad conclusions that are independent of the details of a model. It is used here to show that mechanisms of coexistence and competitive exclusion are largely restricted to three broad categories. One of these categories includes classical mechanisms that do not depend on fluctuations over time. Another category includes mechanisms which may be referred to collectively as the storage effect. These mechanisms involve species-specific responses to environmental fluctuations, a relationship between fluctuations in competition and fluctuations in the environment, and an interaction between environment and competition. The final category depends on fluctuating competition and nonlinear responses to competition that differ between species. These general results are illustrated with analyses of several specific models, including a Lotka-Volterra model, a model of nonlinear resource consumption, and models of recruitment fluctuations for iteroparous organisms and for annual plants. \textcopyright{} 1994 Academic Press.

  abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food. \textcopyright{} 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

  abstract = {Analysis of functional traits is a cornerstone of ecology, yet individual traits seldom explain useful amounts of variation in species distribution or climatic tolerance, and their functional significance is rarely validated experimentally. Multivariate suites of interacting traits could build an understanding of ecological processes and improve our ability to make sound predictions of species success in our rapidly changing world. We use foliar water uptake capacity as a case study because it is increasingly considered to be a key functional trait in plant ecology due to its importance for stress-tolerance physiology. However, the traits behind the trait, that is, the features of leaves that determine variation in foliar water uptake rates, have not been assembled into a widely applicable framework for uptake prediction. Focusing on trees, we investigated relationships among 25 structural traits, leaf osmotic potential (a source of free energy to draw water into leaves), and foliar water uptake in 10 diverse angiosperm and conifer species. We identified consistent, multitrait ``uptake syndromes'' for both angiosperm and conifer trees, with differences in key traits revealing suspected differences in the water entry route between these two clades and an evolutionarily significant divergence in the function of homologous structures. A literature review of uptake-associated functional traits, which largely documents similar univariate relationships, provides additional support for our proposed ``uptake syndrome.'' Importantly, more than half of shared traits had opposite-direction influences on the capacity of leaves to absorb water in angiosperms and conifers. Taxonomically targeted multivariate trait syndromes provide a useful tool for trait selection in ecological research, while highlighting the importance of micro-traits and the physiological verification of their function for advancing trait-based ecology.},

However, substantial environmental changes occurred also within these peninsulas throughout the Pleistocene, raising questions about the role and interplay of various microevolutionary processes in shaping patterns of intraspecific diversity within these areas. Here, we investigate the patterns of genetic variation in the bank vole Myodes glareolus within the Italian peninsula. By using a panel of 13 microsatellite loci, we found more intraspecific variation than expected based on previous assessments. Indeed, both Bayesian and ordination-based clustering analyses of variation recovered five main geographic/genetic clusters along the peninsula, with three clusters geographically restricted to the southern portion of the peninsula. This clustering is supported by previous evidences of some morphological distinctiveness among these populations. This pattern can be explained by a refugia-within-refugia scenario, with the occurrence of multiple sub-refugia for the bank vole within the Italian peninsula, likely promoted by the major palaeo-environmental changes which affected forested habitats within this area during the Pleistocene. Moreover, our results support a scenario whereby the high levels of intraspecific diversity observed within major Pleistocene refugia are better explained by dynamic microevolutionary processes occurred within these areas, rather than by long-term demographic stability of refugial population. Finally, the narrow and isolated distribution of some of the identified lineages suggests the need for future assessments of their conservation and taxonomic status. \textcopyright{} 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

Within the Mamiellophyceae, the genera Micromonas and Ostreococcus dominated in marginal coastal areas affected by open water, whereas Bathycoccus dominated in the lower euphotic depths of oligotrophic open waters. Cryptophyceae and Phaeocystis (of the Prymnesiophyceae) dominated in areas affected principally by coastal water.

First, cellular responses are viewed in an evolutionary perspective, rather than from the more prevailing one, in which the unicellular eukaryotes are seen by the mammalian organisms. Second, results obtained with cell cultures in minimal, chemically defined nutrient media at low cell densities where intercellular signaling is strongly reduced are discussed.

Here we investigated whether variation in mitochondrial oxygen kinetics could contribute to local adaptation and plasticity in response to temperature using two subspecies of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) acclimated to a range of temperatures (5, 15, and 33 \textdegree C). The southern subspecies of F. heteroclitus, which has superior thermal and hypoxia tolerances compared to the northern subspecies, exhibited lower mitochondrial O2 P50 (higher O2 affinity). Acclimation to thermal extremes (5 or 33 \textdegree C) altered mitochondrial O2 P50 in both subspecies consistent with the effects of thermal acclimation on whole-organism thermal tolerance limits. We also examined differences between subspecies and thermal acclimation effects on whole-blood Hb O2-P50 to assess whether variation in oxygen delivery is involved in these responses. In contrast to the clear differences between subspecies in mitochondrial O2-P50 there were no differences in whole-blood Hb-O2 P50 between subspecies. Taken together these findings support a general role for mitochondrial oxygen kinetics in differentiating whole-organism aerobic performance and thus in influencing species responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).}

Relationships between (a ph ({$\lambda$})) and the sum of chlorophyll-a and phaeopigment concentrations (Chl-a) differed from those for the summertime upper mixed layer (UML). Notably, chlorophyll a specific absorption coefficients a ph* ({$\lambda$}) were lower in the DCM and more comparable with a ph* ({$\lambda$}) values typical for winter phytoplankton in the Black Sea. The a ph ({$\lambda$}) spectral shapes in the DCM differed markedly from those in winter and in the summer UML, due to a shoulder at \textasciitilde 490 nm and a local maximum at \textasciitilde 550 nm corresponding to the absorption bands of phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin. Light absorbing properties of phytoplankton in the DCM (amplitude and spectral shape of a ph* ({$\lambda$}) reflected physiological acclimation to local conditions on the cellular level and population shifts leading to changes in the biomass-dominant species, with Synechococcus spp. domination in the DCM. The parameterization of phytoplankton absorption in the DCM will enable refined spectral models of the downwelling radiance and primary production in the Black Sea.},

We found that spring winds and water temperature mediate the intensity of density-dependent survival from the eggs to the age-0 stage. Fall water temperature and juvenile pollock predator abundance mediate density dependence from the age-0 to the age-1 stage. The inclusion of such nonadditive and nonlinear effects in a population dynamics model improved our ability to simulate pollock recruitment. Our results point to the importance of understanding nonadditive and nonlinear interactions between external (climate) and internal factors in the presence of underlying environmental variation. These topics are discussed in the context of current research priorities in population ecology and conservation biology.},

We evaluated single and interactive effects of density reduction of Zostera marina L. (a habitat-forming species), shading, and sediment nutrient enrichment on the response of Z. marina and its associated epifauna over 10 wk. Shading had the greatest effect on reducing the eelgrass relative leaf elongation rate (RLE), non-structural carbohydrate reserves, and eelgrass shoot density. A reduced eelgrass density sustained higher epifaunal densities and increased the eelgrass RLE. Sediment nutrient enrichment increased eelgrass shoot density but decreased epifaunal richness, diversity, and total abundance. Our disturbance and pair of stressors differed in their influence on diversity measures, but all affected assemblage structure. Most of the changes to the epifaunal assemblage and diversity likely occurred due to altered habitat availability and epiphytic algae load. We observed additive, antagonistic, and negatively synergistic interactions among our treatments, while most of the cumulative effects showed dominance by one stressor over another. Our results highlight the importance of field experiments that are based on multiple disturbances and stressors to determine their interaction type on communities.},

However, the usual explanation for trait differences, local adaptation, fails to account for the small-scale phenotypic and genetic divergence observed in fishes and other species with dispersive early life stages. We tested the hypothesis that local-scale variation in the strength of selective mortality in early life mediates the trait composition in later life stages. Through in situ experiments, we manipulated exposure to predators in the coral reef damselfish Dascyllus aruanus and examined consequences for subsequent growth performance under common garden conditions. Groups of 20 recently settled D. aruanus were outplanted to experimental coral colonies in Moorea lagoon and either exposed to natural predation mortality (52\% mortality in three days) or protected from predators with cages for three days. After postsettlement mortality, predator-exposed groups were shorter than predator-protected ones, while groups with lower survival were in better condition, suggesting that predators removed the longer, thinner individuals. Growth of both treatment groups was subsequently compared under common conditions. We did not detect consequences of predator exposure for subsequent growth performance: Growth over the following 37 days was not affected by the prior predator treatment or survival. Genotyping at 10 microsatellite loci did indicate, however, that predator exposure significantly influenced the genetic composition of groups. We conclude that postsettlement mortality did not have carryover effects on the subsequent growth performance of cohorts in this instance, despite evidence for directional selection during the initial mortality phase. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors.

Here, we combine the existing techniques of convergent cross mapping (CCM) and dewdrop regression to build a novel test of causal relations that leverages spatial replication, which we call multispatial CCM. Using examples from simulated and real-world ecological data, we test the ability of multispatial CCM to detect causal relationships between processes. We find that multispatial CCM successfully detects causal relationships with as few as five sequential observations, even in the presence of process noise and observation error. Our results suggest that this technique may constitute a useful test for causality in systems where experiments are difficult to perform and long time series are not available.

  abstract = {Declines in global biodiversity have inspired a generation of studies that seek to characterize relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The metrics for complementarity and selection effects derived by Loreau and Hector in 2001 remain some of the most influential and widely used statistics for studying these relationships. These metrics quantify the degree to which the effect of biodiversity on a given ecosystem function depends on only a few species that perform well in monoculture and in mixture (the selection effect) or if the effect of biodiversity on a given ecosystem function is independent of monoculture performance (the complementarity effect). This distinction may be useful in determining the consequences of the loss of rare versus common or dominant species in natural systems. However, because these metrics require observations of all species in a community in monoculture, applications in natural systems have been limited. Here, we derive a statistical augmentation of the original partition, which can be applied to incomplete random samples of species drawn from a larger pool. This augmentation controls for the bias introduced by using only a subsample of species in monocultures rather than having monocultures of all species. Using simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate the robustness of these metrics, and provide source code for calculating them. We find that these augmentations provide a reliable estimate of complementarity and selection effects as long as approximately 50\% of the species present in mixture are present in monoculture and these species represent a random subset of the mixture. We foresee two primary applications for this method: (a) estimating complementarity and selection effects for experimentally assembled communities where monoculture data are lacking for some species, and (b) extrapolating results from biodiversity experiments to diverse natural systems.},

  abstract = {Physiological and energetic mechanisms have been proposed to constrain body sizes of organisms along climatic gradients; however, these provide contrasting predictions. While Bergmann's rule predicts increases in body sizes in cooler climates resulting from physiological constraints, energy-based community assembly rules suggest declines in the mean body size of species caused by increased extinction probabilities for large-bodied species in low-energy habitats. We tested these contrasting hypotheses by quantifying trait distributions in bee communities along a 3{$\cdot$}6-km elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro. Traditionally, intra- and interspecific trait shifts along environmental gradients have been investigated in isolation. However, a surge of theoretical approaches and studies on plants demonstrated that the explicit integration of trait variation among and within species can be essential for identifying the mechanisms that shape traits and related ecosystem functions along environmental gradients. We therefore studied variation in body size and related morphological traits at both the intra- and interspecific level. We found support for both physiological constraints and energy-based community assembly rules as drivers of trait distribution in bee communities along elevational gradients, which, however, affected different levels of biotic organization, that is the population and community level. While the number of bee species with large body sizes declined with elevation, individuals within species became on average larger, resulting in contrasting trends in morphometric parameters at the community versus population level. Furthermore, body size within bee communities became less variable at higher elevations, largely as a result of a non-random, directive loss of species, but paralleled by a decline in intraspecific variance, suggesting intensified filtering effects with increasing elevation. Similar patterns were found for other functional traits related to the foraging ecology of bees (tongue length, relative forewing length). We conclude that along climatic gradients both physiological and energetic constraints shape trait distributions of pollinators, but at different levels of biological organization. A lay summary is available for this article.},

The effects of marine reserves are heterogeneous. Despite theoretical findings, empirical studies have previously found no effect of size on the effectiveness of marine reserves in protecting commercial fish stocks. Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning.},

  abstract = {In a recent Opinion article in TREE [1], Gurevitch and Padilla concluded that the importance of invasive species in causing declines and extinctions of species is unproven. They analyzed the IUCN Red List database [2] and stated that only 6\% of the taxa are threatened with extinction as a result of invasion by alien species and {$<$}2\% (ten terrestrial plants and no animal species) of the 762 extinctions were the result of the introduction of alien species. We believe that these figures and the message of the article are misleading. The IUCN database includes a searchable hierarchical classification of threats to wildlife (e.g. habitat loss, invasive alien species, harvesting, and so on), which was used by Gurevitch and Padilla in their article [1]. However, this classification system is used in only 5.1\% (39 out of 762) of the extinct species (e.g. there are 129 extinct species of birds, but none of them has been assigned a extinction cause, despite the fact that many are among the best documented cases of extinction) and detailed information about the causes of extinction is provided in other fields of the database (e.g. the robust white-eye Zosterops strenuus, endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia, `was common before 1918, but plummeted to extinction following the arrival of black rat'). We reanalyzed the extinctions included in the IUCN Red List database on a species-by-species basis and reassessed the role of invasive species in those extinctions. The conclusion is radically different from that reached by Gurevitch and Padilla. Of the 680 extinct animal species, causes could be compiled for 170 (25\%), of which 91 (54\%) included the effects of invasive species. For 34 cases (20\%), invasive species were the only cited cause of extinction. Habitat destruction and harvesting (hunting and/or gathering) were cited for 82 and 77 species, respectively. Our results agree with those of recent statistical analyses [3,4], modelling of future scenarios [5], and several reviews of particular taxa by expert groups that have concluded that invasive species are the leading cause of extinction of birds (65 out of 129 spp.) [6] and the second cause of the extinction of North American fish (27 out of 40 spp. [7]), world fish (11 out of 23 spp. [8]) and mammals (12 out of 25 spp. [9]). Although extinction is often the end result of invasions, there are other ecological and evolutionary impacts of biotic homogenization that are less understood [10,11], thus prevention and the precautionary principle are of particular relevance to invasive species.},

A growing body of literature demonstrates the involvement of regulated death programs in the abrupt collapse of phytoplankton populations, and particularly implicates processes that exhibit characteristics of metazoan programmed cell death. Here, we report that the cell-free, extracellular fluid (conditioned medium) of a collapsing aged culture of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is toxic to exponentially growing cells of this cyanobacterium, as well as to a large variety of photosynthetic organisms, but not to eubacteria. The toxic effect, which is light-dependent, involves oxidative stress, as suggested by damage alleviation by antioxidants, and the very high sensitivity of a catalase-mutant to the conditioned medium. At relatively high cell densities, S. elongatus cells survived the deleterious effect of conditioned medium in a process that required de novo protein synthesis. Application of conditioned medium from a collapsing culture caused severe pigment bleaching not only in S. elongatus cells, but also resulted in bleaching of pigments in a cell free extract. The latter observation indicates that the elicited damage is a direct effect that does not require an intact cell, and therefore, is mechanistically different from the metazoan-like programmed cell death described for phytoplankton. We suggest that S. elongatus in aged cultures are triggered to produce a toxic compound, and thus, this process may be envisaged as a novel regulated death program.},

Alkaline potassium permanganate oxidation of phycocyanobilin revealed that the two central pyrrole rings contained the same {$\beta$} substituents as the IX{$\alpha$} bile pigments. The dimethyl esters of phycocyanobilin (mol wt 614), mesobiliverdin (mol wt 614), and biliverdin (mol wt 610) had similar mass spectral fragmentation patterns. The structural differences between phycocyanobilin and mesobiliverdin were proven and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance comparisons and decoupling experiments. The facile isomeriza-tion of phycocyanobilin in alkaline media to a product identical with mesobiliverdin validated the structure proposed for phycocyanobilin. Within experimental error the optical activity of phycocyanobilin isolated from several sources was identical, [formula omitted] +660\textdegree. It is proposed that regardless of the source, phycocyanobilin probably has the same structure and stereo-chemical configuration.

  abstract = {Ocean acidification, rising temperatures, and increased intensity of rain events are occurring due to climate change. Individually, each of these stressors has the potential to influence the growth and survival of many marine organisms, particularly during early development. Together the interactive and multiple impacts of elevated pCO2, temperature, and salinity may be exacerbated by a lack of food. Life history traits are important in determining the response of organisms to climate change. Larvae that develop within a brood chamber, such as the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, may be pre-exposed to living a higher CO2 environment. This study determined the pH of the fluid surrounding the gills of adult oysters where larvae are brooded and investigated the interactive effects of the multiple climate-related stressors: ocean acidification, warming, hyposalinity, and reduced food availability, on development of O. angasi larvae. The fluid surrounding the larvae was of pH 7.88 {$\pm$} 0.04, lower than that of surrounding sea water, and was significantly reduced (to pH 7.46 {$\pm$} 0.05) when oysters remained closed as occurs in nature during periods of stress caused by low salinity. Elevated pCO2 [853\textendash 1194 \textmu atm (pHNBS 7.79)] resulted in larvae being 3 \% smaller, but it had no effect on the timing of progression through developmental stages, percentage of abnormalities, or survival of larvae. Exposure to elevated pCO2 together with increased temperature (+4 \textdegree C) or reduced salinity (20) had a negative effect on the time to the eyed larval stage and with an increase in the percentage of abnormal larvae. Unexpectedly, larvae did not meet their higher metabolic requirements to survive under elevated pCO2 by eating more. In a sublethal effect of elevated pCO2, larval feed- ing was impaired. We found that O. angasi larva were rela- tively resilient to elevated pCO2, a trait that may be due to the acclimatisation of hypercapnic conditions in the brood cavity or because they are released from the brood cavity at an older, possibly less sensitive stage. This result contrasts with the larvae of broadcast spawning oysters which are extremely sensitive to elevated pCO2.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. Aim: Evaluating the effectiveness of marine reserves in achieving conservation goals is challenged by the decadal scales over which biological systems respond following protection. Given that trophic interactions underpin community responses following protection and that complex ecological interactions make responses difficult to identify, quantifying changes in species traits may provide detail missed by traditional diversity measures, including information relevant to ecosystem functioning. We determine whether this is the case by comparing community metrics based on functional traits to taxonomic diversity measures associated with 'no take' marine reserves and partially protected, fished areas along eight degrees of latitude. Location: Eighteen 'no take' marine reserves and 14 partially protected, fished areas along the east coast of Australia. Method: We use two independent datasets from shallow and deep coastal rocky reefs to analyse trait-based metrics and taxonomic diversity from sites inside reserves to sites in partially protected, fished areas. Results: Taxonomic diversity (species diversity and richness) and trait-based multimetrics (functional richness and dispersion) showed no difference with level of protection. Total fish abundance responded positively to protection, but only on shallow reefs. Comparing values of individual functional traits implied a return of larger bodied species of fish in protected areas and an increase in trophic level. The latter was significant on deeper reefs and was strongly correlated with age of protected area. Thus, recovery responses were largely associated with community mean functional trait values, highlighting the value of trait-based approaches for detecting change, when no differences in traditional taxonomic diversity measures were apparent. Main conclusions: We empirically demonstrate that functional traits can elucidate early conservation outcomes, when traditional multimetric diversity indices do not distinguish protected and fished communities. Ecologically relevant but sensitive metrics are fundamental to allow information to be incorporated into adaptive management strategies, which often occur on political rather than biological time-scales.},

Our hypothesis is that phytoplankton consumption by zooplankton in freshwater lakes can be well represented by clustering phytoplankton species into morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and zooplankton species into broad taxonomic units: cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and rotifers. We characterized zooplankton potential grazing on MBFG based on an extensive literature review of experimental data including clearance and ingestion rates. Rotifers show greater potential grazing upon small- and medium-sized species (MBFG I and IV) and presented a Type III trait-based functional response. Cladocerans also show greater potential impact upon MBFG IV but a Type II response. Both groups maintained their respective feeding response regardless of the type of food available, indicating poor food selectivity. Copepods consumed different MBFGs, but a clear Type II pattern was observed when feeding on MBFGs V and VI. Prediction intervals indicated a greater variability in cladocerans' and copepods' response. This approach is a step to summarize and characterize grazing to the future quantification of ecosystem models. Further efforts should be done to include information about different larval stages and phytoplankton traits not directly related to morphology.},

Laboratory studies were conducted by using an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (buthionine sulfoximine) to investigate the effects of glutathione depletion on metallothionein expression, lysosomal membrane destabilization, and lipid peroxidation in Cu-exposed oysters. In oysters exposed to Cu (20 and 80 ??g/l) and buthionine sulfoximine (20 mg/l), metallothionein induction was suppressed and cellular stress responses were frequently higher than those observed in oysters exposed singly to Cu. Together, these results suggest that environmental conditions that cause glutathione depletion may increase the potential for adverse effects to pollutants during in situ exposures.

This is particularly true for species whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses (GSUA) is a robust method to globally investigate the uncertainty of SDMs and the importance of species distributions' drivers in space and time.Here we apply GSUA to MaxEnt that is one of the popular presence-only SDMs. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) (SP) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution is evaluated for MaxEnt. GSUA is applied for three projections of the habitat (2006, 2060, and 2100) according to the A1B sea level rise scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease in habitat suitability in 2060 and 2100 prospecting a low risk of decline for the SP. The regularization parameter for the environmental features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh, transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of iterations for the model training are in this order the most important input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are related to the SP but, in general MaxEnt appears as a very non-linear model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input factors.The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, GSUA need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input factors of the model. GSUA allows quantitative informed species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by resource managers. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Reef corals associate with an extraordinary diversity of dinoflagellate endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium), and this diversity has become critical to understanding how corals respond to environmental changes. A popular molecular marker for Symbiodinium diversity, the Internal Transcribed Spacer-2 (ITS-2) region of ribosomal DNA, has revealed hundreds of distinct variants that are generally interpreted as representing different species, even though many have not been systematically tested for functional or ecological differentiation. Many of these variants are only minimally divergent from one another (1 bp or less), and others occupy basal nodes of traditional species phylogenies ("living ancestors"), indicating that some Symbiodinium ITS-2 diversity may represent intraspecific sequence variation. This hypothesis was tested for Symbiodinium clades A-D (the dominant symbionts of reef corals) through the construction of statistical parsimony networks of ITS-2 sequence diversity, and identification of clusters of closely related sequences within these networks. Initial assessments indicated that ecological differentiation exists between, but not within, these clusters. This approach, although imperfect in its ability to identify species boundaries in all cases, nevertheless dramatically reduces "species" diversity in Symbiodinium (from {$\sim$}175 to 35). This testable alternative hypothesis indicates that, in Symbiodinium, "species" consist of clusters of closely related ITS-2 sequences diverging from ancestral variants that are typically ecologically dominant. A cluster-based view of Symbiodinium ITS-2 diversity improves our ability to: (1) construct well-supported symbiont phylogenies; (2) establish functional niches for symbiont species; and (3) understand flexibility and specificity within coral-algal symbioses. This cluster-based approach can ultimately be integrated with emerging population-level datasets (microsatellites and microsatellite flanking regions) to improve understanding of species diversity in Symbiodinium. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Background: Migrant populations must cope not only with environmental changes in different biomes, but also with the continuous constraints imposed by human-induced changes through landscape transformation and resource patchiness. Theoretical studies suggest that changes in food distribution can promote changes in the social arrangement of individuals without apparent adaptive value. Empirical research on this subject has only been performed at reduced geographical scales and/or for single species. However, the relative contribution of food patchiness and predictability, both in space and time, to abundance and sociality can vary among species, depending on their degree of flexibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: By means of constrained zero-inflated Generalized Additive Models we analysed the spatial distribution of two trans-Saharan avian scavengers that breed (Europe) and winter (Africa) sympatrically, in relation to food availability. In the summering grounds, the probability of finding large numbers of both species increases close to predictable feeding sources, whereas in the wintering grounds, where food resources are widespread, we did not find such aggregation patterns, except for the black kite, which aggregated at desert locust outbreaks. The comparison of diets in both species through stable isotopes revealed that their diets overlapped during summering, but not during wintering. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that bird sociality at feeding grounds is closely linked to the pattern of spatial distribution and predictability of trophic resources, which are ultimately induced by human activities. Migrant species can show adaptive foraging strategies to face changing distribution of food availability in both wintering and summering quarters. Understanding these effects is a key aspect for predicting the fitness costs and population consequences of habitat transformations on the viability of endangered migratory species. \textcopyright{} 2011 Cort\'es-Avizanda et al.}

We do this by analyzing a general eco-evolutionary predator\textendash prey model using four methods: Method 1 identifies how eco-evolutionary feedbacks alter system stability in the fast and slow evolution limits; Method 2 identifies how the amount of standing predator genetic variation alters system stability; Method 3 identifies how the phase lags in predator\textendash prey cycles depend on the amount of genetic variation; and Method 4 determines conditions for different cycle shapes in the fast and slow evolution limits using geometric singular perturbation theory. With these four methods, we identify the conditions under which predator evolution alters system stability and shapes of predator\textendash prey cycles, and how those effect depend on the amount of genetic variation in the predator population. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the relations between the four methods. This work shows how the four methods can be used in tandem to make general predictions about eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks.},

Once operational, reserves became popular with the public and provided economic benefits. In one reserve, 'spill-over' of lobsters counter-balanced lost fishing. The reserves provided the control sites that showed the effects of fishing on ecosystems through depleted populations and habitat change due to trophic cascades. Studies in other countries indicated that these trophic cascades were common globally. Research showed reserves protect benthic and pelagic species, including those that move outside the reserves. These findings benefited from reserves having a map of seabed habitats and data on the relative abundance of species of ecological importance. Information on other species (e.g. macro-invertebrates), and previous and nearby fishing effort over time, may have provided additional insights.Marine Reserves can provide benefits to (1) conservation of species and habitats, (2) science as controls for fishing effects, and (3) fisheries as reference sites that conserve natural genetic and population structure, host brood-stock, and provide spill-over to nearby fisheries. They should be distributed geographically in networks that include replicated examples of habitats and species. To do so, they need to be suitably located, large enough, and enforced to fulfil these opportunities. However, these benefits remain limited by the relatively small area occupied by Marine Reserves within and between countries. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we review ecological literature over the past four decades to evaluate trends in the reporting of ecological interactions (synergies, antagonisms and additive effects) and highlight the implications and importance to conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer terminologies, we find that synergies are (still) not the most prevalent type of interaction, and that conservation practitioners need to appreciate and manage for all interaction outcomes, including antagonistic and additive effects. However, it will not be possible to identify the effect of every interaction on every organism's physiology and every ecosystem function because the number of stressors, and their potential interactions, are growing rapidly. Predicting the type of interactions may be possible in the near-future, using meta-analyses, conservation-oriented experiments and adaptive monitoring. Pending a general framework for predicting interactions, conservation management should enact interventions that are robust to uncertainty in interaction type and that continue to bolster biological resilience in a stressful world.},

Phylogenomic reconstruction indicated a division of Synechococcus in two clades (i.e. Synechococcus and the new genus Parasynechococcus), corroborating evidences that this is in fact a polyphyletic group.

Rates of diversification analysis revealed elevated cladogenesis in all families in the Oligocene/Miocene.

The development of a complex mosaic of reef habitats in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) during the Oligocene/Miocene appears to have been a significant driver of cladogenesis. Patterns of diversification suggest that coral reefs acted as a refuge from high extinction, as reef taxa are able to sustain diversification at high extinction rates.

  abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26\%), synergistic (36\%), and antagonistic (38\%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning. \textcopyright{} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We diluted planktonic microbial communities to determine how decreasing the encounter rate between bacteria, grazers, and viruses affects community structure. In experimental treatments, sea water was diluted 10-fold in water from which protists and bacteria had been removed (0.2 {$\mu$}m filtered), or from which protists bacteria and viruses had been removed (0.02 {$\mu$}m filtered). In both dilution treatments, bacterial and protistan communities generally recovered within 3 d to near their original abundances, but viruses did not. The microbial community structure of bacteria in both diluted treatments was significantly different from untreated control communities, after 3 d, and significantly different between the 0.2 {$\mu$}m and 0.02 {$\mu$}m dilution treatments after 6 d. Diluted treatments were dominated by operational taxonomic units that are normally rare in near-surface seawater, including some normally more abundant in the deep water at this location such as SAR324 and SAR406, while abundant surface taxa including SAR11 did not increase in abundance after dilution. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that microbes face a tradeoff between fast growth and resistance to predation and infection, and that microbes that are normally most abundant in the California coastal surface waters (such as SAR11 and Actinobacteria) are both more grazer resistant and slower growing than potentially opportunistic organisms that are rare in surface water but capable of fast net growth when grazers or viruses are removed.}

We use data from16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.},

However, because realised diversity declines when few species dominate, a positive function-dominance correlation generates a negative relationship between realised diversity and ecosystem functioning within species richness treatments. Removing seed inflow strengthens the link between the function\textendash dominance correlation and BEF relationships across species richness treatments but weakens it within them. These results suggest that changes in species' identities in a local species pool may more strongly affect ecosystem functioning than changes in species richness.},

High latitude regions are predicted to be particularly affected due to cold waters and naturally low carbonate saturation levels. This is of concern for organisms utilising calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) to generate shells or skeletons. Studies of potential effects of future levels of pCO(2) on high latitude calcifiers are at present limited, and there is little understanding of their potential to acclimate to these changes. We describe a laboratory experiment to compare physiological and metabolic responses of a key benthic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, at pCO(2) levels of their natural environment (430 \textmu atm, pH 7.99; based on field measurements) with those predicted for 2100 (735 \textmu atm, pH 7.78) and glacial levels (187 \textmu atm, pH 8.32). Adult L. elliptica basal metabolism (oxygen consumption rates) and heat shock protein HSP70 gene expression levels increased in response both to lowering and elevation of pH. Expression of chitin synthase (CHS), a key enzyme involved in synthesis of bivalve shells, was significantly up-regulated in individuals at pH 7.78, indicating L. elliptica were working harder to calcify in seawater undersaturated in aragonite ({$\Omega$}(Ar) = 0.71), the CaCO(3) polymorph of which their shells are comprised. The different response variables were influenced by pH in differing ways, highlighting the importance of assessing a variety of factors to determine the likely impact of pH change. In combination, the results indicate a negative effect of ocean acidification on whole-organism functioning of L. elliptica over relatively short terms (weeks-months) that may be energetically difficult to maintain over longer time periods. Importantly, however, the observed changes in L. elliptica CHS gene expression provides evidence for biological control over the shell formation process, which may enable some degree of adaptation or acclimation to future ocean acidification scenarios.},

Those minimal state dynamics can be identified using the differential geometric approach to the observability of nonlinear systems, but the theory is limited to only analytical systems. In this paper, we extend the notion of nonlinear observable decomposition to the more general class of data-informed systems. We employ Koopman operator theory, which encapsulates nonlinear dynamics in linear models, allowing us to bridge the gap between linear and nonlinear observability notions. We propose a new algorithm to learn Koopman operator representations that capture the system dynamics while ensuring that the output performance measure is in the span of its observables. We show that a transformation of this linear, output-inclusive Koopman model renders a new minimum Koopman representation. This representation embodies only the observable portion of the nonlinear observable decomposition of the original system. A prime application of this theory is to identify genes in biological systems that correspond to specific phenotypes, the performance measure. We simulate two biological gene networks and demonstrate that the observability of Koopman operators can successfully identify genes that drive each phenotype. We anticipate our novel system identification tool will effectively discover reduced gene networks that drive complex behaviors in biological systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding how changes in biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning is imperative in allowing Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM), especially when addressing global change and environmental degradation. Research into the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has indeed increased considerably over the past decades. BEF research has focussed on terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems have received considerably less attention. Due to differences in phylogenetic diversity, ecological processes and reported BEF relationships, however, it may at least be questionable whether BEF relationships are exchangeable between these ecosystems (i.e. terrestrial and aquatic). The aim of the present paper was therefore to pinpoint key areas and bottlenecks in establishing BEF relationships for aquatic ecosystems (freshwater, transitional, and marine). To this end, the available literature with special emphasis on the last 10 years was assessed to evaluate: i) reported mechanisms and shapes of aquatic BEF relationships; ii) to what extent BEF relations are interchangeable or ecosystem-specific; and iii) contemporary gaps and needs in aquatic BEF research. Based on our analysis, it may be concluded that despite considerable progress in BEF research over the past decades, several bottlenecks still need to be tackled, namely incorporating the multitude of functions supported by ecosystems, functional distinctiveness of rare species, multitrophic interactions and spatial-temporal scales, before BEF relationships can be used in ecosystem-based management.},

  abstract = {Urban areas are an extreme example of human-changed environments, exposing organisms to multiple and strong selection pressures. Adaptive behavioral responses are thought to play a major role in animals' success or failure in such new environments. Approaches based on functional traits have proven especially valuable to understand how species communities respond to environmental gradients. Until recently, they have, however, often ignored the potential consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV). When ITV is prevalent, it may highly impact ecological processes and resilience against stressors. This may be especially relevant in animals, in which behavioral traits can be altered very flexibly at the individual level to track environmental changes. We investigated how species turnover and ITV influenced community-level behavioral responses in a set of 62 sites of varying levels of urbanization, using orb web spiders and their webs as models of foraging behavior. ITV alone explained around one-third of the total trait variation observed among communities. Spider web structure changed according to urbanization, in ways that increase the capture efficiency of webs in a context of smaller urban prey. These trait shifts were partly mediated by species turnover, but ITV increased their magnitude, potentially helping to buffer the effects of environmental changes on communities. The importance of ITV varied depending on traits and on the spatial scale at which urbanization was considered. Despite being neglected from community-level analyses in animals, our results highlight the importance of accounting for intraspecific trait variation to fully understand trait responses to (human-induced) environmental changes and their impact on ecosystem functioning.},

Trait plasticity promotes intraspecific variation and can mediate, increasing or decreasing, interspecific variation. Here we evaluate patterns of ITV and trait-environment relationships in an anuran metacommunity from southern Brazil. We hypothesize that the contribution of ITV and turnover to trait variation and trait-environment relationships should vary between groups of habitats use and traits. To test this, we sampled anurans in 33 ponds and selected the eight most abundant species, which were grouped as arboreal or aquatic-terrestrial according to their use of space. We evaluated the following traits: head shape, eye size and position, limb length and body mass. We divided variation in community trait composition into ITV, variability due to turnover, and also the covariation between them. We modelled trait-environment relationships using linear mixed-effect models. ITV and turnover contributed similarly across traits, but differentially between sets of species. Trait variation seems to be mostly driven by ITV in arboreal anurans and by turnover in aquatic-terrestrial species. Depth, distance between ponds, area of Pinus surrounding the ponds, and types of pond vegetation and substrate strongly influenced trait variation, but their relative contribution depended on the analysed traits and species sets. The dominant contribution of ITV towards the variation of head shape and eye size and position suggests the existence of intraspecific adaptations to microhabitats, while turnover dominance in the variation of body mass and limb length suggests differences in dispersal and trophic segregation between species.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic variance results from variation in biological information possessed by individuals. Quantitative geneticists often strive to partition out all environmental variance to measure heritability. Behavioral biologists and ecologists however, require methods to integrate genetic and environmental components of inherited phenotypic variance in order to estimate the evolutionary potential of traits, which encompasses any form of information that is inherited. To help develop this integration, we build on the tools of quantitative genetics and offer the concept of `inclusive heritability' which identifies and unifies the various mechanisms of information transmission across generations. A controversial component of non-genetic information is animal culture, which is the part of phenotypic variance inherited through social learning. Culture has the unique property of being transmitted horizontally and obliquely, as well as vertically. Accounting for cultural variation would allow us to examine a broader range of evolutionary mechanisms. Culture may, for instance, produce behavioral isolating mechanisms leading to speciation. To advance the study of animal culture, we offer a definition of culture that is rooted in quantitative genetics. We also offer four testable criteria to determine whether a trait is culturally inherited. These criteria may constitute a conceptual tool to study animal culture. We briefly discuss methods to partition out cultural variance. Several authors have recently called for `modernizing the modern synthesis' by including non-genetic factors such as epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in order to more fully explain phenotypic evolution. Here, we further propose to broaden the concept of inheritance by incorporating the cultural component of behavior. Applying the concept of inclusive heritability may advance the integration of multiple forms of inheritance into the study of evolution.},

We review the field from its foundation in limiting similarity theory in the 1960s to its resurgence in 2000s, and find the theory of trait patterning still in a stage of development. Elements still to be accounted for include environmental fluctuations, multidimensional niche space, transient dynamics, immigration, intraspecific variation, evolution and spatial scales. Recent empirical methods are better than early approaches, but still focus on patterning arising in simplistic models, and should rigorously link niche space with trait space, use informative null models, and adopt new metrics of pattern as theory develops. Because tests based on overly simplistic expectations of trait pattern are of little value, we argue that progress in the field requires theory development, which should entail exploring patterns across a set of conceptual and system-specific models of competition along trait axes},

We found that, on average, mortalities from the combined action of two stressors were not synergistic and this result was consistent across studies investigating different stressors, study organisms and life-history stages. Furthermore, only one-third of relevant experiments displayed truly synergistic effects, which does not support the prevailing ecological paradigm that synergies are rampant. However, in more than three-quarters of relevant experiments, the outcome of multiple stressor interactions was non-additive (i.e. synergies or antagonisms), suggesting that ecological surprises may be more common than simple additive effects. \textcopyright{} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

This makes MERIS a potentially valuable sensor for the measurement and monitoring of terrestrial environments at regional to global scales. The red edge, which results from an abrupt reflectance change in red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has a location that is related directly to the chlorophyll content of vegetation. A new index called the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) uses data in three red/NIR wavebands centered at 681.25, 708.75 and 753.75 nm (bands 8, 9 and 10 in the MERIS standard band setting). The MTCI is easy to calculate and can be automated. Preliminary indirect evaluation using model, field and MERIS data suggested its sensitivity to chlorophyll content, notably at high values. As a result this index is now a standard level-2 product of the European Space Agency. For direct MTCI evaluation two approaches were used. First, MTCI/chlorophyll content relationships were determined using a chlorophyll content surrogate for sites in southern Vietnam and second, MTCI/chlorophyll relationships were determined using actual chlorophyll content for sites in the New Forest, UK and for plots in the greenhouse. Forests in southern Vietnam were contaminated heavily with herbicides during the Vietnam War. This led to a long term decrease in chlorophyll content within forests that have long since regained full canopy cover. The amount of herbicide dropped onto the forests between 1965 and 1971 was used as a surrogate (inverse) for contemporary chlorophyll content and was related to current MTCI at selected forest sites. The resulting relationship was both strong and negative. Further per-pixel investigation of the MTCI/herbicide concentration relationship is under way for large forest regions. In the second approach MTCI was related directly to chlorophyll content at two scales and the initial relationships were both of strong and positive. Further plans involve MTCI evaluation at local, regional and eventually global scales. \textcopyright{} 2006 COSPAR.},

One mechanism by which temperature may affect stability is by altering trophic interactions. The functional response quantifies the per capita resource consumption by the consumer as a function of resource abundance and is a suitable framework for the description of nonlinear trophic interactions. We studied the effect of temperature on a ciliate predator\textendash prey pair (Spathidium sp. and Dexiostoma campylum) by estimating warming effects on the functional response and on the associated conversion efficiency of the predator. We recorded prey and predator dynamics over 24 hr and at three temperature levels (15, 20 and 25\textdegree C). To these data, we fitted a population dynamic model including the predator functional response, such that the functional response parameters (space clearance rate, handling time and density dependence of space clearance rate) were estimated for each temperature separately. To evaluate the ecological significance of temperature effects on the functional response parameters, we simulated predator\textendash prey population dynamics. We considered the predator\textendash prey system to be destabilized, if the prey was driven extinct by the predator. Effects of increased temperature included a transition of the functional response from a Type III to a Type II and an increase of the conversion efficiency of the predator. The simulated population dynamics showed a destabilization of the system with warming, with greater risk of prey extinction at higher temperatures likely caused by the transition from a Type III to a Type II functional response. Warming-induced shifts from a Type III to II are not commonly considered in modelling studies that investigate how population dynamics respond to warming. Future studies should investigate the mechanism and generality of the effect we observed and simulate temperature effects in complex food webs including shifts in the type of the functional response as well as consider the possibility of a temperature-dependent conversion efficiency.},

Thresholds based on calcium concentrations, an element critical for mussel growth and physiology, have been used as a primary predictor of quagga mussel establishment success to aid management decisions. We evaluated the invasion potential of quagga mussels in low calcium waters using laboratory experiments to compare the survival, growth and reproductive potential of adult mussels held for 90 days at low (9 and 12 ppm), moderate (15 to 32 ppm) and high (72 ppm) calcium water concentrations. In conjunction with adult experiments, veliger stage survival, growth and settlement were evaluated under similar low, moderate, and high calcium water treatments. Adult mussels survived, grew and showed reproductive potential in low calcium water (12 ppm). Veligers were also able to survive, grow and settle in low calcium water. Higher levels of natural seston biomass appeared to improve adult mussel life history performance in low calcium water. Survival curve analysis predicted that 99\% adult mortality could occur in \textexclamdown 170 days at 9 ppm and 12 ppm, however water with \textquestiondown 15 ppm could have adults surviving more than a year.

We tested for intraspecific phenotypic variation in three bird species within the Purus\textendash Madeira interfluvium (Central Amazon) and whether phenotypes were correlated with environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance among sites. We compared coloration indexes derived from reflectance spectra and morphometrics of up to five adult individuals of each sex among 11 sites within the interfluvium and contrasted them with proxies for geographic distance and environmental variation (tree basal area and bird community). Environmental heterogeneity was minimally spatially autocorrelated, and there were no obvious geographical barriers to dispersal in the study region. The null hypothesis was that we would see either no phenotypic variation or random variation that was not explained by the tested variables. Half of the cases analyzed showed intraspecific morphological variation. Coloration varied more frequently than morphometrics, and color was better explained by environmental heterogeneity, particularly in males, whereas brightness also varied with geographic distance. Geographic distance explained the only case of variation in morphometrics. Our results indicate that coloration, particularly plumage brightness, is more labile than morphometric traits and that plumage color might be under stronger effects of local adaptation than brightness, which also seems to be under effects of neutral drift and gene flow among populations. Higher frequencies of association between male coloration and the environment suggest a role of non-arbitrary mechanisms of sexual selection on the expression of male phenotypes, whereas arbitrary intersexual selection might explain the randomly distributed variation that is not explained by environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance. We revealed intraspecific phenotypic variation in a spatial extent usually not considered in biogeographic studies in the Amazon and demonstrate that both local adaptation and neutral drift are important to explain intraspecific trait diversification at this geographical scale. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {1. Interactions between biodiversity loss and climate change present significant challenges for research, policy and management of ecosystems. Evidence suggests that high species diversity tends to increase plant community stability under interannual climate fluctuations and mild dry and wet events, but the overall pattern of diversity stability relationships under climate extremes is unclear. 2. We comprehensively review results from observational and experimental studies to assess the importance of diversity effects for ecosystem function under climate extremes. Both the broad literature review and a meta-analysis focused on the effects of extreme precipitation events on above-ground biomass reveal no significant interaction between species richness and climate extremes. 3. Causes for variation in diversity effects under climate extremes are explored, from stress thresholds to biotic interactions and community assembly, and we consider how these may modulate the outcomes of biodiversity-stability relationships. We also examine how specific characteristics of climate extremes and timing of measurements may interact with mechanisms of diversity-stability relationships. 4. Synthesis. Hypotheses tailored to the complexity of diversity effects, the implementation of standardised experiments and the use of trait-based biodiversity measures rather than species richness should lead to better causal understanding of whether and how biodiversity may protect ecosystems from adverse effects of climate extremes.

Here we show that sponges make DOM available to fauna by rapidly expelling filter cells as detritus that is subsequently consumed by reef fauna. This ``sponge loop'' was confirmed in aquarium and in situ food web experiments, using 13C- and 15N-enriched DOM. The DOM-sponge-fauna pathway explains why biological hot spots such as coral reefs persist in oligotrophic seas\textemdash the reef's paradox\textemdash and has implications for reef ecosystem functioning and conservation strategies.},

At high concentrations, lower settings of intraspecific variability resulted in predictions of community extinction that were not supported by the observed SADs.

  abstract = {Understanding the joint effect of multiple drivers of environmental change is a key scientific challenge. The dominant approach today is to compare observed joint effects with predictions from various types of null models. Drivers are said to combine synergistically (antagonistically) when their observed joint effect is larger (smaller) than that predicted by the null model. Here, I argue that this approach does not promote understanding of effects on important community- and ecosystem-level variables such as biodiversity and ecosystem function. I use ecological theory to show that different mechanisms can lead to the same deviation from a null model's prediction. Inversely, I show that the same mechanism can lead to different deviations from a null model's prediction. These examples illustrate that it is not possible to make strong mechanistic inferences from null models. Next, I present an alternative framework to study such effects. This framework makes a clear distinction between two different kinds of drivers (resource ratio shifts and multiple stressors) and integrates both by incorporating stressor effects into resource uptake theory. I show that this framework can advance understanding because of three reasons. First, it forces formalization of ``multiple stressors,'' using factors that describe the number and kind of stressors, their selectivity and dynamic behaviour, and the initial trait diversity and tolerance among species. Second, it produces testable predictions on how these factors affect biodiversity and ecosystem function, alone and in combination with resource ratio shifts. Third, it can fail in informative ways. That is, its assumptions are clear, so that different kinds of deviations between predictions and observed effects can guide new experiments and theory improvement. I conclude that this framework will more effectively progress understanding of global change effects on communities and ecosystems than does the current practice of null model testing.},

In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis and visualization strategy that provides an interactive and reproducible framework to generate pangenomes and to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the context of a large-scale marine metagenomic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genomes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, phylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing availability of environmental metagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the functioning and the ecology of microbial populations, and metapangenomes can provide unique insights for any taxon and biome for which genomic and sufficiently deep metagenomic data are available.},

A standard 96 h static algal bioassay was used to determine pesticide effects on the population growth rate of D. tertiolecta. Mixture toxicity was assessed using the additive index approach. Atrazine and chlorothalonil concentrations {$>$} or = 25 microg/L and 33.3 microg/L, respectively, caused significant decreases in D. tertiolecta population growth rate. At much higher concentrations ({$>$} or = 400 microg/L) chlorpyrifos also elicited a significant effect on D. tertiolecta population growth rate, but toxicity would not be expected at typical environmental concentrations. The population growth rate EC50 values determined for D. tertiolecta were 64 microg/L for chlorothalonil, 69 microg/L for atrazine, and 769 microg/L for chlorpyrifos. Atrazine and chlorpyrifos in mixture displayed additive toxicity, whereas atrazine and chlorothalonil in mixture had a synergistic effect. The toxicity of atrazine and chlorothalonil combined was approximately 2 times greater than that of the individual chemicals. Therefore, decreases in phytoplankton populations resulting from pesticide exposure could occur at lower than expected concentrations in aquatic systems where atrazine and chlorothalonil are present in mixture. Detrimental effects on phytoplankton population growth rate could impact nutrient cycling rates and food availability to higher trophic levels. Characterizing the toxicity of chemical mixtures likely to be encountered in the environment may benefit the pesticide registration and regulation process.},

Global climate change will have a wide range of effects on estuarine habitats, including potentially increasing water temperature and salinity, which may alter the risk assessment of estuarine pollutants. We examined the effects of increasing temperature and salinity on the toxicity of common herbicides (irgarol, diuron, atrazine, and ametryn) to the phytoplankton species Dunaliella tertiolecta. Static 96-h algal bioassays were conducted for each herbicide under four exposure scenarios: standard temperature and salinity (25\textdegree C, 20 ppt), standard temperature and elevated salinity (25\textdegree C, 40 ppt), elevated temperature and standard salinity (35\textdegree C, 20 ppt), and elevated temperature and elevated salinity (35\textdegree C, 40 ppt). The endpoints assessed were algal cell density at 96 h, growth rate, chlorophyll a content, lipid content, and starch content. Increasing exposure temperature reduced growth rate and 96-h cell density but increased the cellular chlorophyll and lipid concentrations of the control algae. Exposure condition did not alter starch content of control algae. Herbicides were found to decrease growth rate, 96 h cell density, and cellular chlorophyll and lipid concentrations, while starch concentrations increased with herbicide exposure. Herbicide effects under standard test conditions were then compared with those observed under elevated temperature and salinity. Herbicide effects on growth rate, cell density, and starch content were more pronounced under elevated salinity and temperature conditions. To encompass the natural variability in estuarine temperature and salinity, and to account for future changes in climate, toxicity tests should be conducted under a wider range of environmental conditions. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Question: How many vegetation plot observations (relev\'es) are available in electronic databases, how are they geographically distributed, what are their properties and how might they be discovered and located for research and application? Location: Global. Methods: We compiled the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD;), an Internet resource aimed at registering metadata on existing vegetation databases. For inclusion, databases need to (i) contain temporally and spatially explicit species co-occurrence data and (ii) be accessible to the scientific public. This paper summarizes structure and data quality of databases registered in GIVD as of 30 December 2010. Results: On the given date, 132 databases containing more than 2.4 million non-overlapping plots had been registered in GIVD. The majority of these data were in European databases (83 databases, 1.6 million plots), whereas other continents were represented by substantially less (North America 15, Asia 13, Africa nine, South America seven, Australasia two, multi-continental three). The oldest plot observation was 1864, but most plots were recorded after 1970. Most plots reported vegetation on areas of 1 to 1000m 2; some also stored time-series and nested-plot data. Apart from geographic reference (required for inclusion), most frequent information was on altitude (71\%), slope aspect and inclination (58\%) and land use (38\%), but rarely soil properties ({$<$}7\%). Conclusions: The vegetation plot data in GIVD constitute a major resource for biodiversity research, both through the large number of species occurrence records and storage of species co-occurrence information at a small scale, combined with structural and plot-based environmental data. We identify shortcomings in available data that need to be addressed through sampling under-represented geographic regions, providing better incentives for data collection and sharing, developing user-friendly database exchange standards, as well as tools to analyse and remove confounding effects of sampling biases. The increased availability of data sets conferred by registration in GIVD offers significant opportunities for large-scale studies in community ecology, macroecology and global change research. \textcopyright{} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

This review and synthesis describes how the effects of thermal variation\textemdash in both time and space\textemdash can be estimated by applying a simple, nonlinear averaging scheme. The method is first applied to the temporal variation experienced by an individual, providing an estimate of the individual's average performance. The method is then applied to the scale-dependent thermal variation among individuals, which is modelled as a 1/f-noise phenomenon. For an individual, thermal variation reduces average performance, lowers the temperature of maximum performance (Topt) and contracts the range of viable temperatures. Thermal variation among individuals similarly reduces performance and lowers Topt, but increases the viable range of average temperatures. These results must be viewed with caution, however, because they do not take into account the time-dependent interaction between body temperature and physiological plasticity. Quantifying these interactions is perhaps the largest challenge for ecological and conservation physiologists as they attempt to predict the effects of climate change.},

However, whether the trait co-ordination observed at the global scale occurs at other ecological scales (especially within species) remains an open question. Here, for sapling communities of two tropical dry forest types in Costa Rica, we show large differences amongst traits in the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to their directional changes in response to environmental changes along a successional gradient. We studied the response of functional traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum and drought tolerance using intensive sampling to analyse inter- and intra-specific responses to environmental changes and ontogeny. Although the overall functional composition of the sapling communities changed during succession more through species turnover than through intraspecific trait variation, their relative contributions differed greatly amongst traits. For instance, community mean specific leaf area changed mostly due to intraspecific variation. Traits of the leaf economics spectrum showed decoupled responses to environmental drivers and ontogeny. These findings emphasise how divergent ecological mechanisms combine to cause great differences in changes of individual functional traits over environmental gradients and ecological scales. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).}

These changes in the climate, however, do not act alone, and are often accompanied by additional stressors such as eutrophication. Both global warming and eutrophication have been shown to affect the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. Little is known about the combined effects of rising temperatures and eutrophication on the stoichiometry of entire phytoplankton communities. We exposed a natural phytoplankton spring community to different warming and phosphorus-loading scenarios using a full- factorial design. Our results demonstrate that rising temperatures promote the growth rate of an entire phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both rising temperatures and phosphorus loading stimulated the maximum biomass built up by the phytoplankton community. Rising temperatures led to higher carbon : nutrient stoichiometry of the phytoplankton community under phosphorus-limited conditions. Such a shift towards higher carbon : nutrient ratios, in combination with a higher biomass buildup, suggests a temperature-driven increase in nutrient use efficiency, the phytoplankton community. Importantly, with higher carbon : nutrient stoichiometry, phytoplankton is generally of poorer nutritional value for zooplankton. Thus, although warming may result in higher phytoplankton biomass, this may be accompanied by a stoichiometric mismatch between phytoplankton and their grazers, with possible consequences for the entire aquatic food web.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s). Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.},

Intraspecific variation, which includes the genomic and phenotypic diversity found within and among populations, is threatened by local extinctions, abundance declines, and anthropogenic selection. However, biodiversity assessments often fail to highlight this loss of diversity within species. We review the literature on how intraspecific variation supports critical ecological functions and nature's contributions to people (NCP). Results show that the main categories of NCP (material, non-material, and regulating) are supported by intraspecific variation. We highlight new strategies that are needed to further explore these connections and to make explicit the value of intraspecific variation for NCP. These strategies will require collaboration with local and Indigenous groups who possess critical knowledge on the relationships between intraspecific variation and ecosystem function. New genomic methods provide a promising set of tools to uncover hidden variation. Urgent action is needed to document, conserve, and restore the intraspecific variation that supports nature and people. Thus, we propose that the maintenance and restoration of intraspecific variation should be raised to a major global conservation objective.},

The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been dramatically altered by such invasions, especially zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels. Responses to mussel invasions have included increased water clarity, and decreased chlorophyll and phytoplankton abundance. Although not all systems have responded similarly, in general, mussels have changed nutrient dynamics and physical habitat conditions. Therefore examination of different impacts can help us further understand mechanisms that underlie ecosystem responses to biological invasions. To aid our understanding of ecosystem impacts, we sampled established locations along a well-studied trophic gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, after the 1993 zebra mussel invasion. A strong trophic gradient remained during the period sampled after the mussel invasion (2000\textendash 2012). However, mean summer chlorophyll increased and other measures of phytoplankton biomass (microscope and electronic cell counting) did not change significantly. Multivariate analyses of phytoplankton community structure demonstrate a significant community shift after the invasion. Cyanobacteria increased in dominance, with Microcystis becoming the major summer taxon in lower Green Bay. Diatom diversity and abundance also increased and Chlorophyta became rare. Phytoplankton responses along the trophic gradient of Green Bay to zebra mussel invasion highlight the importance of mussel effects on nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton diversity and function.},

Here, I show how quantitative genetics tools have been extended to account for a wider diversity of phenotypic traits using first the threshold model and then more recently using generalized linear mixed models. I explore the assumptions behind these models and how they can be used to study the genetics of non-Gaussian complex traits. I also comment on three recent methodological advances in quantitative genetics that widen our ability to study new kinds of traits: the use of ``modular'' hierarchical modeling (e.g., to study survival in the context of capture\textendash recapture approaches for wild populations); the use of aster models to study a set of traits with conditional relationships (e.g., life-history traits); and, finally, the study of high-dimensional traits, such as gene expression.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. Investigating the environment through an ES framework has gained wide acceptance in the international scientific community and is applied by policymakers to protect biodiversity and safeguard the sustainability of ecosystems. This approach can enhance the ecological and societal relevance of pre-market/prospective environmental risk assessments (ERAs) of regulated stressors by: (1) informing the derivation of operational protection goals; (2) enabling the integration of environmental and human health risk assessments; (3) facilitating horizontal integration of policies and regulations; (4) leading to more comprehensive and consistent environmental protection; (5) articulating the utility of, and trade-offs involved in, environmental decisions; and (6) enhancing the transparency of risk assessment results and the decisions based upon them. Realisation of these advantages will require challenges that impede acceptance of an ES approach to be overcome. Particularly, there is concern that, if biodiversity only matters to the extent that it benefits humans, the intrinsic value of nature is ignored. Moreover, our understanding of linkages among ecological components and the processes that ultimately deliver ES is incomplete, valuing ES is complex, and there is no standard ES lexicon and limited familiarity with the approach. To help overcome these challenges, we encourage: (1) further research to establish biodiversity\textendash ES relationships; (2) the development of approaches that (i) quantitatively translate responses to chemical stressors by organisms and groups of organisms to ES delivery across different spatial and temporal scales, (ii) measure cultural ES and ease their integration into ES valuations, and (iii) appropriately value changes in ES delivery so that trade-offs among different management options can be assessed; (3) the establishment of a standard ES lexicon; and (4) building capacity in ES science and how to apply ES to ERAs. These development needs should not prevent movement towards implementation of an ES approach in ERAs, as the advantages we perceive of using this approach render it more than worthwhile to tackle those challenges. Society and the environment stand to benefit from this shift in how we conduct the ERA of regulated stressors.},

We argue that many ecologically damaging invaders are characterised by their more efficient use of resources. Consequently, comparison of the classical 'functional response' (relationship between resource use and availability) between invasive and trophically analogous native species may allow prediction of invader ecological impact. We review the utility of species trait comparisons and the history and context of the use of functional responses in invasion ecology, then present our framework for the use of comparative functional responses. We show that functional response analyses, by describing the resource use of species over a range of resource availabilities, avoids many pitfalls of 'snapshot' assessments of resource use. Our framework demonstrates how comparisons of invader and native functional responses, within and between Type II and III functional responses, allow testing of the likely population-level outcomes of invasions for affected species. Furthermore, we describe how recent studies support the predictive capacity of this method; for example, the invasive 'bloody red shrimp' Hemimysis anomala shows higher Type II functional responses than native mysids and this corroborates, and could have predicted, actual invader impacts in the field. The comparative functional response method can also be used to examine differences in the impact of two or more invaders, two or more populations of the same invader, and the abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. parasitism) context-dependencies of invader impacts. Our framework may also address the previous lack of rigour in testing major hypotheses in invasion ecology, such as the 'enemy release' and 'biotic resistance' hypotheses, as our approach explicitly considers demographic consequences for impacted resources, such as native and invasive prey species. We also identify potential challenges in the application of comparative functional responses in invasion ecology. These include incorporation of numerical responses, multiple predator effects and trait-mediated indirect interactions, replacement versus non-replacement study designs and the inclusion of functional responses in risk assessment frameworks. In future, the generation of sufficient case studies for a meta-analysis could test the overall hypothesis that comparative functional responses can indeed predict invasive species impacts. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Thioredoxin and glutathione (GSH) are two of the major small molecular weight thiol-containing compounds synthesized de novo in mammalian cells that participate in those functions. Understanding the mechanisms of thiol metabolism has special relevance to understanding the cell's defense against toxicant exposure and as the focal point in redox signaling. This commentary will, however, focus on GSH consumption and synthesis, and the role of thiols in signaling. The chemical reactions of GSH, including conjugation reactions mediated by glutathione S-transferases (GST) and oxidation reactions mediated by glutathione peroxidases will be described. The regulation of GSH synthesis will be illustrated from a compilation of studies designed to understand the various levels at which enzymatic GSH biosynthesis is controlled, and the signaling pathways that mediate them. The response of the cell to 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), a reactive aldehyde produced physiologically in response to inflammation and various air pollutants, will be explored in detail. Finally, the direct role of thiols as signaling molecules will be addressed, with particular attention given to "redox state." It is our aim that this commentary will lead the reader to appreciate that studies investigating the signaling for and regulation of thiol metabolism must never be generalized, and that perturbations in any of step of thiol metabolism may have etiological roles in genetically, virally, and environmentally borne pathologies. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

For example, \^a\oe chaos\^a is one of its typical topics. Recently the preservation of endangered species has become one of the most important issues in biology and environmental science, because of the recent rapid loss of biodiversity in the world. In this respect, permanence or persistence, new concepts in dynamical systems theory, seem important. These concepts give a new aspect in mathematics that includes various nonlinear phenomena such as chaos and phase transition, as well as the traditional concepts of stability and oscillation. Permanence and persistence analyses are expected not only to develop as new fields in mathematics but also to provide useful measures of robust survival for biological species in conservation biology and ecosystem management. Thus the study of dynamical systems will hopefully lead us to a useful policy for bio-diversity problems and the conservation of endangered species. The above fact brings us to recognize the importance of collaborations among mathematicians, biologists, environmental scientists and many related scientists as well. Mathematicians should establish a mathematical basis describing the various problems that appear in the dynamical systems of biology, and feed back their work to biology and environmental sciences. Biologists and environmental scientists should clarify/build the model systems that are important in their own global biological and environmental problems. In the end mathematics, biology and environmental sciences develop together.},

These events can produce a range of organismal responses that may help to protect local-scale populations against changes in climate. Empirical studies examining intraspecific variation in reproductive and physiological responses to varying durations of environmental stress are rare. We performed laboratory experiments under varying episodic and chronic salinities using the botryllid ascidians, Botrylloides nigrum and Botryllus planus. Our study illustrates intraspecific phenotypic variation to salinity stress. Respectively 40 and 20\% of B. nigrum and B. planus colonies exhibited a distinct physical behavior when exposed to low salinity treatments. They distended their cloacal cavities, exposing their pharyngeal baskets and neural glands. Physiological signs of salinity stress included higher mortality, lower heart rates and limited asexual reproduction in both species. The physical and physiological differences among clones and colonies highlight phenotypic variation within and between genotypes to selective environmental pressures in real time. Our results underscore the need to examine physiological responses of species under varying durations of environmental stress. Plastic responses of species to fine-scale environmental change may aid their persistence in a future where extreme climatic events are likely to be more common and acute. \textcopyright{} 2016 Inter-Research.},

In this review, we highlight advancements in current environmental studies investigating the interactive effects between warming and contaminants in freshwater and marine invertebrates. We not only focused on temperate regions but also synthesized information on the less studied Arctic/Antarctic and tropical regions. Recent Findings: In general, the same combination of warming and contaminants may result in either additive or non-additive interactive effects depending on taxa, the response variable, life stage, genotype, exposure level, duration and order of exposure, and the number of exposed generations. For traditional contaminants such as metals and pesticides, combined effects with warming at the individual level were generally synergistic. Growing evidence suggests that multigenerational exposure can shift the interaction between warming and contaminants toward antagonism, while contemporary evolution may change the interaction type. Summary: Our synthesis highlights the importance of temporal aspects in shaping interaction type, including order of exposure, ontogenetic effects, transgenerational effects, and evolution. The combination of laboratory experiments (to advance mechanistic understanding) and outdoor mesocosm studies or field observations (to increase realism) is needed to obtain comprehensive assessments of interactive effects of warming and pollutants from genes to ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Summary: Freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate change and pollution. One key challenge for aquatic toxicology is to determine and manage the combined effects of temperature increase and contaminants across species' ranges. We tested how thermal adaptation and life-history evolution along a natural temperature gradient influence the vulnerability of an aquatic insect to a pesticide under global warming. We applied a space-for-time substitution approach to study the effect of warming on the vulnerability of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae to the pesticide chlorpyrifos in a common garden warming experiment (20 and 24 \textdegree C) with replicated populations from three latitudes spanning \textquestiondown 1500 km in Europe. Chlorpyrifos was more toxic to damselfly larvae at the higher temperature: mortality only occurred at 24 \textdegree C and the reductions in growth rate were stronger at 24 \textdegree C. This could partly be explained by parallel reductions in food intake but not by the activities of two widespread enzymatic biomarkers, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). There was some evidence that the increased toxicity of the high chlorpyrifos concentration at 24 \textdegree C was stronger in terms of growth reduction in the faster-growing larvae from the low-latitude populations. This is consistent with energy allocation trade-offs between growth rate and pesticide tolerance, but suggests that local thermal adaptation does not play a role in coping with pesticide stress. Synthesis and applications. Damselfly larvae from populations in lower latitudes were more vulnerable to a common pesticide at higher temperatures and pesticide concentrations, whereas evidence for the influence of local thermal adaptation on the vulnerability of larvae was weak. These results emphasize the need for spatially explicit bioassessment and conservation tools. Management practices aimed at mitigating pesticide run-off into aquatic ecosystems are particularly important in agricultural areas at low latitudes. \textcopyright{} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species1, 3. In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow1, 3, 4. Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching18, 23, 24, 25. Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

  abstract = {In many species, nongenetic phenotypic variation helps mitigate risk associated with an uncertain environment. In some cases, developmental cues can be used to match phenotype to environment-a strategy known as predictive plasticity. When environmental conditions are entirely unpredictable, generating random phenotypic diversity may improve the long-term success of a lineage-a strategy known as diversified bet hedging. When partially reliable information is available, a well-adapted developmental strategy may strike a balance between the two strategies. We use information theory to analyze a model of development in an uncertain environment, where cue reliability is affected by variation both within and between generations. We show that within-generation variation in cues decreases the reliability of cues without affecting their fitness value. This transpires because the optimal balance of predictive plasticity and diversified bet hedging is unchanged. However, withingeneration variation in cues does change the developmental mechanisms used to create that balance: developmental sensitivity to such cues not only helps match phenotype to environment but also creates phenotypic diversity that may be useful for hedging bets against environmental change. Understanding the adaptive role of developmental sensitivity thus depends on a proper assessment of both the predictive power and the structure of variation in environmental cues. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both are high priorities for future research. Although ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may be only imperfect analogs to current conditions.},

Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall `stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

  abstract = {Species contributing high proportions to community biomass strongly influence ecosystem processes within the community. Studies have shown that dominant species may serve as nurse plants, helping to ensure biomass stability of the subordinate species under stress conditions. The question is widely debated as to whether either niche differentiation or neutral processes drive the net outcome of plant interactions within a subordinate plant community. To answer this question, requires precise estimates of individual variation in functional traits and performance. In a 5-year mesocosm experiment, the functional responses of a subordinate plant community to the removal of the dominant species were evaluated across two drought-stress scenarios. Small-scale (i.e. large pots) wetland communities were constructed comprising one dominant species Carex elata and three subordinate species. Removal of the dominant species allowed evaluation of the net effects of drought and interspecific interactions. We estimated the functional divergences for three traits (SLA, leaf dry matter content and allocation to height growth) and compared these with performance differences quantified individually. This enabled distinctions to be made between deterministic (i.e. niche differentiation) and neutral processes driving the drought response of the subordinate community. We showed that the dominant species decreased relative performance differences within the subordinate plant community under conditions of permanent drought stress. These changes were associated with the convergence of traits related to resource acquisition and growth. The dominant species equalized species performance differences by supressing relatively drought-tolerant species with low competitive ability and by supporting the less drought-tolerant species with relatively high competitive ability. Meanwhile, under conditions of inter-annual drought, the subordinate species likely coexisted due to differentiation in resource-use strategies and the interaction with the dominant species. Inclusion of individual variation in performance with a functional trait approach provides valuable insights into the processes structuring plant communities. Ours is the first study to provide evidence that subordinate species exposed to drought may coexist via neutral processes arising from their interactions with the dominant species, leading to functional convergence of traits associated with the trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive ability.

  abstract = {Intertidal organisms are exposed to a suite of fluctuating environmental variables, but the relative influences of these variables on physiology have rarely been disentangled. We examined spatial and temporal variation in the enzymatic capacities for ATP generation (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] and citrate synthase [CS]) and for detoxification of reactive oxygen species (superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT]) at four microsites within a single population of the California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) over a 5-day period. At both a wave-exposed, cooler location and a protected, warmer location, mussels lower in the intertidal zone had higher rates of CS, MDH, and SOD activity than individuals situated higher on the shore. Activities of CS, CAT, and SOD also tended to be lower at the protected than at the exposed location. We simultaneously monitored two environmental variables that might influence mussels' biochemical status. Body temperature was recorded in mussel mimics, and food availability was derived from in situ measurements of chlorophyll a concentration and wave heights, to estimate feeding periods at each microsite. Recent food availability dominates over thermal history (the amount of recent heating) in determining the biochemical capacities of these mussels over the time windows we examined (up to the past 64. h in 8. h increments). Activities of CS, MDH, and CAT were positively correlated with recent food availability at nearly all time windows. In contrast, only infrequently was thermal history negatively correlated with activities of CS (past 8. h and 64. h), CAT (past 16-24. h), and SOD (past 48-64. h). Opportunistic field sampling in the subsequent summer also showed that enzymatic activities align better with recent food availability than with recent thermal history. A controlled laboratory study confirmed that elevation of body temperature has no impact on the enzymes measured. In both laboratory and field experiments, there were strong positive correlations between enzymes that perform a related function (e.g., r. = 0.667 between MDH and CS) as well as between the potential for ATP generation and the capacity to combat oxidative stress (e.g., 0.593. \textexclamdown. r. \textexclamdown. 0.769 between CS and CAT). Activities of MDH, CS and SOD decreased with increasing body size (metabolic scaling effect). The finding that food availability supersedes body temperature in determining metabolic status highlights the importance of considering small-scale spatial and temporal variation in multiple environmental variables that might impinge upon physiological rates, particularly when conducting large-scale surveys.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Microbial assemblages at two sites along the C-111 canal in the Dade County agricultural area in October 1999 (wet season, limited pesticide application) and in February 2000 (dry season, heavy pesticide application) were colonized onto artificial substrates, transported to the laboratory and exposed to atrazine (20 and 200 {$\mu$}g/l), chlorothalonil (2 and 20 {$\mu$}g/l), or endosulfan (1 and 10 {$\mu$}g/l). Structural and functional responses were measured at 24 h and 168 h post-dose. Regardless of site, season or exposure time, the highest atrazine dose (200 {$\mu$}g/l) significantly reduced chlorophyll a, phototrophic carbon assimilation and bacterial biomass, but stimulated heterotrophic bacterial productivity. Chlorophyll a was also significantly reduced by 20 {$\mu$}/l atrazine (October only). The lowest endosulfan dose (1 {$\mu$}g/l) significantly increased phototrophic carbon assimilation. The highest chlorothalonil dose (20 {$\mu$}g/l) stimulated heterotrophic bacterial productivity (October only). An overall decrease in the number of protist taxa was observed with all pesticide treatments. Atrazine significantly decreased the relative abundance of chlorophytes and chrysophytes and increased the number of diatom and heterotrophic protist taxa. Chlorothalonil significantly increased the relative abundance of diatoms and chlorophytes, while chrysophytes and heterotrophic protists decreased. Endosulfan also significantly reduced diatom abundance, as well as decreasing the number of chrysophyte, cryptophyte and dinoflagellate taxa. Although previous agricultural pesticide exposure was greater at site C than at site E, the microbial assemblages at site C did not exhibit increased resistance to a subsequent dose of the pesticides.},

In common with most other phagotrophs studied, Oxyrrhis had to be supplied with a natural source of lipid growth factors for axenic cultivation, lemon rind or grass extracts in this instance (Droop, 1959). The eventual replacement of these natural sources by ubiquinone (Droop \& Doyle, 1966) cleared the way for the development of a completely denned culture medium for Oxyrrhis and the completion of the nutritional study, the water-soluble nutrients having been fully worked out previously (Droop, 1959). However, identification of this requirement immediately raises two questions. The answer to the first, whether ubiquinone is the only lipid required, appears to be in the negative, and the details of an additional, fairly specific, steroid requirement are presented in the second part of this paper. The other question concerns the specificity of the quinone requirement. Is the quinone merely a convenient source of the benzene ring \textendash{} mammals require at least one aromatic compound in the diet \textendash{} or does it act as a true growth factor, in which case the requirement would be unique and would have more than protozoological interest?},

Mountain uplifts are known to catalyse species radiation but their impact on evolutionarily stable taxa such as many trees remains little understood. The oak Quercus aquifolioides is endemic to yet widely distributed across the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we investigate how the region's Neogene and Quaternary history has driven the species' past population dynamics and the resulting extant patterns of intraspecific diversity. Location: Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in SW China. Methods: We sampled 58 populations throughout the species range and genotyped a total of 959 individuals at four chloroplast DNA fragments and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating techniques and ancestral area reconstructions were used in combination with population genetic statistics to infer the biogeographical history of Q. aquifolioides. The phylogeographical study was complemented by a survey of fossil records and a niche modelling exercise. Results: Combined molecular and fossil evidence indicates that Q. aquifolioides descended during the late Miocene from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into Tibet and the western Sichuan Plateau, and from there, into the area of highest endemism in the Hengduan Mountains sensu lato. Great apparent population stability and a haplotype `radiation' in this area contrasted with marked extinction\textendash recolonization dynamics and reduced population diversity in Tibet. We found evidence for extremely limited seed gene flow but extensive pollen gene flow (global F ST : cpDNA = 0.98, nSSR = 0.07) with signals of asymmetric pollen dispersal from the Hengduan Mountains into Tibet. Main conclusion: Our results provide insights of unprecedented detail into the ancient biogeographical history of the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot, suggesting that past environmental changes in the region may have catalysed radiative diversifications within species much in the same way as among species. \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

These ecosystems provide nursery grounds and food for fish and invertebrates, coastline protection from erosion, carbon sequestration, and nutrient fixation. For marine macrophytes, temperature is generally the most important range limiting factor, and ocean warming is considered the most severe threat among global climate change factors. Ocean warming induced losses of dominant macrophytes along their equatorial range edges, as well as range extensions into polar regions, are predicted and already documented. While adaptive evolution based on genetic change is considered too slow to keep pace with the increasing rate of anthropogenic environmental changes, rapid adaptation may come about through a set of non-genetic mechanisms involving the functional composition of the associated microbiome, as well as epigenetic modification of the genome and its regulatory effect on gene expression and the activity of transposable elements. While research in terrestrial plants demonstrates that the integration of non-genetic mechanisms provide a more holistic picture of a species' evolutionary potential, research in marine systems is lagging behind. Here, we aim to review the potential of marine macrophytes to acclimatize and adapt to major climate change effects via intraspecific variation at the genetic, epigenetic, and microbiome levels. All three levels create phenotypic variation that may either enhance fitness within individuals (plasticity) or be subject to selection and ultimately, adaptation. We review three of the most important phenotypic variations in a climate change context, including physiological variation, variation in propagation success, and in herbivore resistance. Integrating different levels of plasticity, and adaptability into ecological models will allow to obtain a more holistic understanding of trait variation and a realistic assessment of the future performance and distribution of marine macrophytes. Such multi-disciplinary approach that integrates various levels of intraspecific variation, and their effect on phenotypic and physiological variation, is of crucial importance for the effective management and conservation of seagrasses and macroalgae under climate change. \textcopyright{} 2018 Duarte, Martins, Rosa, Matos, Roleda, Reusch, Engelen, Serr\~ao, Pearson, Marques, Ca\c{c}ador, Duarte and Jueterbock.},

Although disentangling these scale effects is of prime importance in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology, most studies dealing with the links between phenotype and the environment have mainly focused on the landscape scale, and none has addressed the interactions between effects at both scales. In ectotherms, movement abilities are strongly dependent upon thermoregulation abilities, and thus likely vary with latitude. Moreover, in such species, movement is also highly dependent upon landscape geometry at the landscape scale. Here, we quantified the combined effects of latitude and habitat fragmentation on movement ability in relation with thermoregulation abilities in the butterfly Pieris brassicae as model for understanding the relative contributions of macro-ecological and landscape scale effects on species' mobility. We sampled individuals at an early developmental stage (eggs or caterpillars), in natural populations from 27 sites with different degrees of habitat connectivity, along a latitudinal gradient across France and Belgium. Adult flight and heating rate were measured in laboratory controlled conditions and were used as proxies for movement ability and thermoregulation ability, respectively. We found that flight endurance for both sexes and female heating rate increased with latitude. Habitat connectivity had a sex-dependent effect on both traits: flight endurance in males increased with decreasing habitat connectivity, while the opposite was found in females. Moreover, heating rate increased with increasing habitat connectivity, the effect being stronger in males. Overall, our results highlight the need to integrate intraspecific variation in movement ability at different spatial scales when studying species' responses to global environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors.

Six of twelve currently described tribes are assigned to the "H-lineage," an assemblage of exclusively mouthbrood-ing cichlids, all of which evolved during a short period of time during the course of the primary radiation of lacustrine species. Our study focuses on the deepwater tribe Limnochromini, comprising bi-parental mouthbrooders, and is based on phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial gene segments. We confirm the polyphyletic origin of the Limnochromini as they are defined to date, in that Gnathochromis pfefferi is placed among the Tropheini, whereas the genus Benthochromis is presented as an independent lineage. The remaining nine species were unambiguously resolved as monophyletic and should be redefined as the tribe Limnochromini. Concerning generic assignments, the genus Greenwoodochromis appeared as monophyletic, Limnochromis as paraphyletic, and the genera Reganochromis and Baileychromis as monophyletic sister genera. The linearized tree analysis and the comparison of average sequence divergences to that of the remaining tribes of the H-lineage revealed a relatively recent but simultaneous proliferation of the Limnochromini, suggesting that the same environmental changes triggered the radiation of particular deepwater, benthic, pelagic, and littoral lineages. By using a preliminary calibration of a molecular clock based on gamma-corrected amino acid distances of the NADH2 gene, the diversification of the Limnochromini could tentatively be dated to 2.9-3.5 MYA, coinciding with a period of aridification in East Africa between 2.5 and 3 MYA. The lack of geographic color morphs and the structural uniformity and resource scarcity of deepwater habitats suggest that competition and resource partitioning leading to differential trophic specialization promoted speciation within the Limnochromini, rather than an allopatric model. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

While morphometrics is continuously enriched with new, more efficient techniques describing shape, the question remains for the morphologist whether an efficient removing of within-species size variation is sufficient to produce stable, specific characters. Is a single species metrically recognizable in spite of its geographical variation? To address this question the intraspecific variation in 10 neotropical sandflies was examined within and between large South American ecogeographic regions: the Amazonian region, the Sub-Andean and the Chaco regions of Bolivia, and the Atlantic Coast of Brazil. Thus, the geographic stability of metric properties, as derived from measurements between landmarks, was investigated 10 times allowing a total of 29 inter-regional and 13 intra-regional conspecific comparisons. Metric proportions remained stable among conspecific populations of a single ecogeographic region. From one region to another, however, size-independent changes were significant and their amount was correlated with altitude. This could reflect an important role of some environmental changes in shaping the insects, and should be taken into account when using morphometrics to identify sandflies. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Species loss in ecosystems can lead to secondary extinctions as a result of consumer-resource relationships and other species interactions. We compare levels of secondary extinctions in communities generated by four structural food-web models and a fifth null model in response to sequential primary species removals. We focus on various aspects of food-web structural integrity including robustness, community collapse and threshold periods, and how these features relate to assumptions underlying different models, different species loss sequences and simple measures of diversity and complexity. Hierarchical feeding, a fundamental characteristic of food-web structure, appears to impose a cost in terms of robustness and other aspects of structural integrity. However, exponential-type link distributions, also characteristic of more realistic models, generally confer greater structural robustness than the less skewed link distributions of less realistic models. In most cases for the more realistic models, increased robustness and decreased levels of web collapse are associated with increased diversity, measured as species richness S., and increased complexity, measured as connectance C. These and other results, including a surprising sensitivity of more realistic model food webs to loss of species with few links to other species, are compared with prior work based on empirical food-web data. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society.},

This method can be used to find out if, when ecological targets following from the European Water Framework Directive are not met, this is caused by toxic substances. The method can also be used to identify sources of toxic substances. Traditionally, mainly chemical techniques are applied for these purposes, but the disadvantage is that they do not cover the large amounts of chemicals potentially present in surface waters. The method uses bioassays. For this purpose, the response of five species in the water under investigation is studied. If a response is found, the substances causing this can be identified (if desired). The method enables to investigate the combined effects of substances (synergistic or antagonistic). Another advantage can be achieved by sample pre-treatment with a resin, allowing to concentrate the toxic substances. This way acute tests can be used instead of chronic test (which are more expensive) even if no acute effects can be found in the original (not concentrated) sample. In addition, natural factors that influence the toxicity of surface water do not disturb the method after this pre-treatment. Unfortunately, the toxicity of metals can not be investigated with this method},

Moreover, most Synechococcus lineages bifurcated after the Great Oxidation Event, including the most abundant marine picoplankton lineage. Quantification of horizontal gene transfer among 70 cyanobacterial genomes revealed significant differences among studied genomes. Horizontal gene transfer levels were not correlated with ecology, genome size or phenotype, but were correlated with the age of divergence.

However, the evolutionary forces leading to their divergence and speciation remain largely enigmatic compared to macroorganisms due to their prokaryotic nature, including vast population sizes, and largely asexual reproduction. The advent of modern molecular techniques has facilitated an understanding of the important factors shaping cyanobacterial evolution, including horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination. We review the forces shaping the evolution of cyanobacteria and discuss the role of cohesive forces on speciation. Further, while myriad species concepts and definitions are currently used, only a limited subset might be applied to cyanobacteria due to their asexual reproduction. Additionally, concepts based solely on phenotypes provide insufficient resolution. A monophyletic species concept which is universal may be ideal for cyanobacteria. Actual identification of the cyanobacteria is difficult due to cryptic diversity, lack of morphological variability, and frequent convergent evolutionary events. Thus, applied molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding will be useful for identifications of environmental samples. Lastly, we show that the real biodiversity of the cyanobacteria is widely underestimated, due in part to low sampling efforts, sensitivity to the molecular markers employed, and the species definitions employed by researchers. In conclusion, we anticipate a rapid increase in cyanobacterial taxa described and large revisions of the system in the future as scientists adopt a common approach to cyanobacterial systematics.},

  abstract = {Plant communities can respond to environmental changes by altering their species composition and by individuals (within species) adjusting their physiology. These responses can be captured by measuring key functional traits among and within species along important environmental gradients. Some anthropogenic changes (such as fertilizer runoff ) are known to induce distinct community responses, but rarely have responses across natural and anthropogenic gradients been compared in the same system. In this study, we used comprehensive specific leaf area (SLA) data from a diverse Australian annual plant system to examine how individual species and whole communities respond to natural and anthropogenic gradients, and to climatically different growing seasons. We also investigated the influence of different leaf-sampling strategies on community-level results. Many species had similar mean SLA values but differed in SLA responses to spatial and temporal environmental variation. At the community scale, we identified distinct SLA responses to natural and anthropogenic gradients. Along anthropogenic gradients, increased mean SLA, coupled with SLA convergence, revealed evidence of competitive exclusion. This was further supported by the dominance of species turnover (vs. intraspecific variation) along these gradients. We also revealed strong temporal changes in SLA distributions in response to increasing growingseason precipitation. These climate-driven changes highlight differences among co-occurring species in their adaptive capacity to exploit abundant water resources during favorable seasons, differences that are likely to be important for species coexistence in this system. In relation to leaf-sampling strategies, we found that using leaves from a climatically different growing season can lead to misleading conclusions at the community scale. \textcopyright{} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

With the decline in coral cover, sponges have also become more dominant members of Caribbean coral reef communities. Increased algal and sponge dominance on Caribbean reefs has led to an increase in the frequency of interaction between these 2 groups. This study used a factorial design to assess the independent and interactive effects of contact and elevated nutrient levels on 2 common members of these communities, the sponge Aplysina cauliformis, and the macroalga Microdictyon marinum. Algal contact had a significant negative physiological effect on A. cauliformis, affecting both the host sponge and its cyanobacterial symbionts. While elevated nutrient levels had some positive effects on the sponge photosymbionts, this only occurred in the absence of algal contact or a shading/abrasion control, and elevated nutrient levels had a negative effect on the sponge holobiont. In contrast, M. marinum responded positively to experimentally enhanced nutrient levels and to sponge contact under ambient nutrient regimes, but was not affected by sponge contact under elevated nutrient concentrations. Stable isotope enrichment experiments showed that the alga's positive response to sponge contact was associated with nitrogen transfer from the sponge over the course of the experiment. Thus, while A. cauliformis facilitates increased productivity in M. marinum, algal contact competitively inhibits sponge condition. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2014.},

A strong positive linear relationship was observed between the LC50 (the PAH concentration at which cell population will decline by a half), and the species cell volume, for both phenanthrene and pyrene. Natural communities were however significantly more sensitive to PAHs than cultured phytoplankton, as indicated by the lower slope (e.g. 0.23 and 0.65, respectively, for pyrene) of the relationship LC50 vs. cell volume.

Overall, 162 species, including diadromous and euryhaline, with documented occurrence records in freshwaters, and taxa of unclarified taxonomic status, are accom- modated in the distributional compilation. An annotated checklist summarises the confirmed ichthy- ofauna of Greek freshwaters (161 species); a provisional supplementary list contains species recorded in brackish waters (55 species). In comparison to the last published (1991) checklist of freshwater fish of Greece, the present checklist shows an increase in species number of 53\% (56 species). This increase has resulted mainly from taxonomic re-evaluations of existing taxa on the basis of new information and adop- tion of a new systematic concept. The current trend, as reflected in recent ichthyological publications, is towards abandonment of the biological species concept (BSC) and adoption of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) for the delineation of species boundaries. The practical implications of the change in species concept on biodiversity conservation and watershed management are discussed. An overview of the composition and characteristics of the freshwater fish fauna of Greece is provided, especially with regard to the native and introduced status of species, and the spatial patterns of species richness and endemism. This systematic inventory may assist in efforts to develop nation-wide surface water bioassess- ment tools within the demands of the Water Framework Directive (WFD); it may further promote biodi- versity conservation and biologically-orientated fishery management approaches}

MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve. Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old ({$>$}10 years), large ({$>$}100\,km(2)), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large ({$>$}250\,mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59\%) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.},

The concentrations of various contaminants (metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAHs) were quantified in oyster's tissue from each site and both metals and total PAHs were significantly elevated in contaminated estuaries relative to the reference estuary. Lysosomal membrane destabilisation, lipid peroxidation levels and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were measured in the digestive gland of oysters. Of all biomarkers measured, lysosomal membrane destabilisation proved to be the most useful indicator of oysters facing anthropogenic stress and we suggest this may be an especially useful biomarker for incorporation into local environmental monitoring programs. Moreover, lysosomal membrane destabilisation showed good correlations with fertilisation, normal embryo development and estuary status. GSH and lipid peroxidation were not as valuable for distinguishing between estuaries exposed to differing levels of anthropogenic stress, but did provide additional valuable information regarding overall health status of the oysters.},

We exposed the arctic-boreal sponge Geodia barretti to the primary particulate components of two water-based drilling muds; barite and bentonite. Sponges were exposed to barite, bentonite and a natural reference sediment at a range of total suspended solid concentrations (TSS = 0, 10, 50 or 100 mg/L) for 12 h after which we measured a suite of biomarker responses (lysosomal membrane stability, lipid peroxidation and glutathione). In addition, we compared biomarker responses, organic energy content and metal accumulation in sponges, which had been continuously or intermittently exposed to suspended barite and natural sediment for 14 d at relevant concentrations (10 and 30 mg TSS/L). Lysosomal membrane stability was reduced in the sponges exposed to barite at 50 and 100 mg TSS/L after just 12 h and at 30 mg TSS/L for both continuous and intermittent exposures over 14 d. Evidence of compromised cellular viability was accompanied by barite analysis revealing concentrations of Cu and Pb well above reference sediments and Norwegian sediment quality guidelines. Metal bioaccumulation in sponge tissues was low and the total organic energy content (determined by the elemental composition of organic tissue) was not affected. Intermittent exposures to barite resulted in less toxicity than continuous exposure to barite. Short term exposures to bentonite did not alter any biomarker responses. This is the first time that these biomarkers have been used to indicate contaminant exposure in an arctic-boreal sponge. Our results illustrate the potential toxicity of barite and the importance of assessments that reflect the ways in which these contaminants are delivered under environmentally realistic conditions.},

There are significant differences across taxa in a and lmax, with dinoflagellates, raphidophytes, and diazotrophs having the lowest values for both traits, and Phaeocystis spp. and diatoms having relatively high values. Iopt does not vary among taxonomic groups, and all traits exhibit large variation within most groups. Open-ocean isolates tend to have higher a, lower Iopt, and lower lmax than coastal isolates, implying adaptation to low light and low productivity. The three traits are correlated across species such that a and Iopt are negatively related while lmax is positively correlated with both of these traits. There is some evidence that high a carries a cost of high N demand even when nitrogen (not light) is limiting. The results elucidate contrasting light-related ecological strategies across phytoplankton and should help improve the parameterization of major functional groups in biogeochemical models.}

  abstract = {Temperature strongly affects phytoplankton growth rates, but its effect on communities and ecosystem processes is debated. Because phytoplankton are often limited by light, temperature should change community structure if it affects the traits that determine competition for light. Furthermore, the aggregate response of phytoplankton communities to temperature will depend on how changes in community structure scale up to bulk rates. Here, we synthesize experiments on 57 phytoplankton species to analyze how the growth-irradiance relationship changes with temperature. We find that light-limited growth, light-saturated growth, and the optimal irradiance for growth are all highly sensitive to temperature. Within a species, these traits are co-adapted to similar temperature optima, but light-limitation reduces a species' temperature optimum by {$\sim$}5\textdegree C, which may be an adaptation to how light and temperature covary with depth or reflect underlying physiological correlations. Importantly, the maximum achievable growth rate increases with temperature under light saturation, but not under strong light limitation. This implies that light limitation diminishes the temperature sensitivity of bulk phytoplankton growth, even though community structure will be temperature-sensitive. Using a database of primary production incubations, we show that this prediction is consistent with estimates of bulk phytoplankton growth across gradients of temperature and irradiance in the ocean. These results indicate that interactions between temperature and resource limitation will be fundamental for explaining how phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical processes vary across temperature gradients and respond to global change.},

Current research increasingly integrates ecology and evolution over a range of timescales, but our common conceptual framework for understanding species coexistence requires better incorporation of evolutionary processes. Here, we focus on the idea of evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), which are theoretical endpoints of evolution in a community context. We use ESCs as a unifying framework to highlight some important but under-appreciated theoretical results, and we review empirical research relevant to these theoretical predictions. We explain how, in addition to generating diversity, evolution can also limit diversity by reducing the effectiveness of coexistence mechanisms. The coevolving traits of competing species may either diverge or converge, depending on whether the number of species in the community is low (undersaturated) or high (oversaturated) relative to the ESC. Competition in over-saturated communities can lead to extinction or neutrally coexisting, ecologically equivalent species. It is critical to consider trait evolution when investigating fundamental ecological questions like the strength of different coexistence mechanisms, the feasibility of ecologically equivalent species, and the interpretation of different patterns of trait dispersion.},

In a mesocosm experiment, we manipulated genotypic diversity of eelgrass patches fully crossed with water temperature (control vs. temperature stress) over 5 mo. We found a strong negative effect of warming and a positive effect of genotypic diversity on shoot densities of eelgrass. These results suggest that eelgrass meadows and associated ecosystem services will be negatively affected by predicted increases in summer temperature extremes.

In our model cargo-carrying protein motors, driven by proton-motive force, move along a continuous looped helical track. The movement of the cargo creates surface distortions in the form of small amplitude traveling ridges along the S-layer above the helical track. The resulting fluid motion adjacent to the helical ribbon provides the propulsive thrust. A variation on the helical rotor model of [1] allows the motors to be anchored to the peptidoglycan layer, where they drive rotation of the track creating traveling helical waves along the S-layer. We derive expressions relating the swimming speed to the amplitude, wavelength, and velocity of the surface waves induced by the helical rotor, and show that they fall in reasonable ranges to explain the velocity and rotation rate of swimming Synechococcus.},

Focusing on plant-plant interactions, we review empirical studies exemplifying how intraspecific genetic variation in functional traits impacts plant coexistence. Intraspecific variation in chemical and architectural traits promotes species coexistence, by both increasing habitat heterogeneity and altering competitive hierarchies. Decomposing species interactions into interactions between genotypes shows that genotype \texttimes{} genotype interactions are often intransitive. The outcome of plant-plant interactions varies with local adaptation to the environment and with dominant neighbour genotypes, and some plants can recognize the genetic identity of neighbour plants if they have a common history of coexistence. Taken together, this reveals a very dynamic nature of coexistence. We outline how more traits mediating plant-plant interactions may be identified, and how future studies could use population genetic surveys of genotype distribution in nature and methods from trait-based ecology to better quantify the impact of intraspecific genetic variation on plant coexistence.},

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

  abstract = {Rapid contemporary evolution due to natural selection is common in the wild, but it remains uncertain whether its effects are an essential component of community and ecosystem structure and function. Previously we showed how to partition change in a population, community or ecosystem property into contributions from environmental and trait change, when trait change is entirely caused by evolution (Hairston 2005). However, when substantial non-heritable trait change occurs (e.g. due to phenotypic plasticity or change in population structure) that approach can mis-estimate both contributions. Here, we demonstrate how to disentangle ecological impacts of evolution vs. non-heritable trait change by combining our previous approach with the Price Equation. This yields a three-way partitioning into effects of evolution, non-heritable phenotypic change and environment. We extend the approach to cases where ecological consequences of trait change are mediated through interspecific interactions. We analyse empirical examples involving fish, birds and zooplankton, finding that the proportional contribution of rapid evolution varies widely (even among different ecological properties affected by the same trait), and that rapid evolution can be important when it acts to oppose and mitigate phenotypic effects of environmental change. Paradoxically, rapid evolution may be most important when it is least evident. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Within Africa, several mammals have extensive geographic distributions with attendant morphological, ecological, and behavioural variations, which are often used to demarcate subspecies. In the present study, we use a primate species, the vervet monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops, as a case study for intraspecific divergence in widespread mammals, assessed through hard tissue morphology. We examine intraspecific differences in size, shape, and non-allometric shape from a taxonomic perspective, and discuss the macroevolutionary implications of findings from microevolutionary analyses of geographic variation. A geometric morphometric approach was used, employing 86 three-dimensional landmarks of almost 300 provenanced crania. Many of the taxonomic differences in skull morphology between vervet populations appear to be related to geographic proximity, with subspecies at opposite extremes of a west-to-east axis showing greatest divergence, and populations from central and south Africa being somewhat intermediate. The classification rate from discriminant analyses was lower than that observed in other African primate radiations, including guenons as a whole and red colobus. Nonetheless, taxonomic differences in shape were significant and not simply related to either geography or size. Thus, although shifts in size may be an important first step in adaptation and diversification, with size responding more quickly than shape to environmental change, the six vervet taxa currently recognized (either as species or subspecies) are not simply allometrically scaled versions of one another and are probably best viewed as subspecies. Holding allometry constant when examining inter-population differences in shape may thus help to reveal the early stages of evolutionary divergence. The vervet case study presented here hence has relevance for future studies examining intraspecific differentiation in other large mammals, particularly through the methods used to identify small but biologically meaningful divergence, with attendant implications for conservation planning. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Linnean Society of London.},

It was important to identify the mussel gender to reliably assess the changes in organism energy budget. CEA value was calculated as a ratio between available energy (E) and energy consumption (E). Mantle tissue was under the strongest influence of the differences in protein and lipid content between male and female mussels, and therefore reflected physiological changes in the organism itself, rather than those caused by natural environmental stress. CEA in gills had lower values than in mantle and digestive gland, and was similar at two selected sampling sites, so the changes in CEA caused by natural stress could not be detected in the gill tissue. Greater E, in mussels from the estuarine site than from the coastal site was detected only in the digestive gland tissue, and can probably be attributed to the energetically costly maintenance of osmotic balance.

We found strong correlations between Calanus abundance/population structure and a number of sea ice parameters. These relationships were particularly strong for C. glacialis, with higher numbers being observed at locations with a lower ice concentration, a shorter distance to the ice edge, and more days of open water. Interestingly, early stages of C. hyperboreus followed the same trends, suggesting that these two species substantially overlap in their core distribution area in the Arctic Ocean. Calanus glacialis and C. hyperboreus have been historically classified as shelf versus basin species, yet we conclude that both species can inhabit a wide range of bottom depths and their distribution in the Arctic Ocean is largely shaped by sea ice dynamics. Our data suggest that the core distribution patterns of these key zooplankton are shifting northwards with retreating sea ice and changing climate conditions.},

An important stress response is the Nrf-2 mediated oxidative stress response pathway where electrophilic chemicals or chemicals that cause the formation of reactive oxygen species initiate the production of antioxidants and metabolic detoxification enzymes. The AREc32 cell line is sensitive to chemicals inducing oxidative stress and has been previously applied for water quality monitoring of organic micropollutants and disinfection byproducts. Here we propose an algorithm for the derivation of effect-based water quality trigger values for this end point that is based on the combined effects of mixtures of regulated chemicals. Mixture experiments agreed with predictions by the mixture toxicity concept of concentration addition. The responses in the AREc32 and the concentrations of 269 individual chemicals were quantified in nine environmental samples, ranging from treated effluent, recycled water, stormwater to drinking water. The effects of the detected chemicals could explain less than 0.1\% of the observed induction of the oxidative stress response in the sample, affirming the need to use effect-based trigger values that account for all chemicals present.},

  abstract = {Cell-based bioassays are becoming increasingly popular in water quality assessment. The new generations of reporter-gene assays are very sensitive and effects are often detected in very clean water types such as drinking water and recycled water. For monitoring applications it is therefore imperative to derive trigger values that differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable effect levels. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a statistical method to read directly across from chemical guideline values to trigger values without the need to perform invitro to invivo extrapolations. The derivation is based on matching effect concentrations with existing chemical guideline values and filtering out appropriate chemicals that are responsive in the given bioassays at concentrations in the range of the guideline values. To account for the mixture effects of many chemicals acting together in a complex water sample, we propose bioanalytical equivalents that integrate the effects of groups of chemicals with the same mode of action that act in a concentration-additive manner. Statistical distribution methods are proposed to derive a specific effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalent concentration (EBT-BEQ) for each bioassay of environmental interest that targets receptor-mediated toxicity. Even bioassays that are indicative of the same mode of action have slightly different numeric trigger values due to differences in their inherent sensitivity. The algorithm was applied to 18 cell-based bioassays and 11 provisional effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalents were derived as an illustrative example using the 349 chemical guideline values protective for human health of the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. We illustrate the applicability using the example of a diverse set of water samples including recycled water. Most recycled water samples were compliant with the proposed triggers while wastewater effluent would not have been compliant with a few. The approach is readily adaptable to any water type and guideline or regulatory framework and can be expanded from the protection goal of human health to environmental protection targets. While this work constitutes a proof of principle, the applicability remains limited at present due to insufficient experimental bioassay data on individual regulated chemicals and the derived effect-based trigger values are of course only provisional. Once the experimental database is expanded and made more robust, the proposed effect-based trigger values may provide guidance in a regulatory context.},

  abstract = {Despite the growing evidence for individual variation in trophic niche within populations, its potential indirect effects on ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. In particular, few studies have investigated how intraspecific trophic variability can modulate the effects of consumers on ecosystems through potential changes in nutrient excretion rates. Here, we first quantified the level of intraspecific trophic variability in 11 wild populations of the omnivorous fish Lepomis gibbosus. Outputs from stomach content and stable isotope analyses revealed that the degree of trophic specialization and trophic positions were highly variable between and within these wild populations. There was intrapopulation variation in trophic position of more than one trophic level, suggesting that individuals consumed a range of plant and animal resources. We then experimentally manipulated intraspecific trophic variability to assess how it can modulate consumer-mediated nutrient effects on relevant processes of ecosystem functioning. Specifically, three food sources varying in nutrient quality (e.g. plant material, macro-invertebrate and fish meat) were used individually or in combination to simulate seven diet treatments. Results indicated that intraspecific variability in growth and nitrogen excretion rates were more related to the composition of the diet rather than the degree of specialization, and increased with the trophic position of the diet consumed. We subsequently used microcosms and showed that critical ecosystem functions, such as primary production and community respiration, were affected by the variability in excretory products, and this effect was biomass-dependent. These results highlight the importance of considering variation within species to better assess the effects of individuals on ecosystems and, more specifically, the effects of consumer-mediated nutrient recycling because the body size and the trophic ecology of individuals are affected by a large spectrum of natural and human-induced environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors}

  abstract = {During a mesocosm study in Raunefjorden, Norway, a Micromonas spp. population, initially showing exponential net growth, dramatically declined after Day 4 of the experiment. Using a modification of the dilution approach originally developed to quantify grazing by microzooplankton on phytoplankton, it was possible to partition the mortality of Micromonas spp. between grazing and viral lysis on Days 5, 6 and 7 during the population decline. Parallel dilution experiments were carried out in which 0.2 mum- and 10 kDa-filtered water was used as the diluents. In this way, gradients of grazing pressure (0.2 pm series) and grazing pressure + viral concentration (10 kDa series) were produced. Model 1 linear regression of the fraction of whole water versus the apparent growth rate of chlorophyll a and Micromonas spp. provided an estimate of mortality in the 0.2 pm and 10 kDa dilution series. On Days 5, 6 and 7, the slopes of the linear regressions of 0.2 pm and 10 kDa dilution series were significantly different at p = 0.083, 0.001 and 0.093 respectively. From the differences in slope between the series, estimates of viral mortality amounted to a turnover rate of the Micromonas spp. standing stocks of 10, 25 and 9\% d(-1). This compares to a turnover rate by the microzooplankton of 48, 26 and 23\% d(-1). On all 3 d the combined viral lysis and grazing mortality exceeded estimates of the potential production of Micromonas spp., in part accounting for the population decline. This study demonstrates that the dilution approach can be adapted to directly determine virus-induced mortality rates of specific phytoplankton. However, further work is required to determine how the specificity of viral infection and variety of viral infection cycles affect the results of this modified dilution approach when applied to other phytoplankton taxa and communities.},

Viral production in the eastern SAZ (2.2 x 10(11) viruses l(-1) day(-1)) was the highest recorded and was approximately one order of magnitude higher than at the other sites. In the western SAZ and PFZ, the percentage of available bacterial biomass lysed by viruses was similar (23.5\% and 23\% respectively) equating to the release of 3.3 and 2.3 microg carbon l(-1) day(-1) respectively (assuming a burst size of 50 viruses host(-1)). In the eastern SAZ the potential bacterial biomass lysed was higher (on average 40\%) and corresponded to the release of 26.5 microg carbon l(-1) day(-1).

  abstract = {Winter habitat use and the magnitude of migratory connectivity are important parameters when assessing drivers of the marked declines in avian migrants. Such information is unavailable for most species. We use a stable isotope approach to assess these factors for three declining African-Eurasian migrants whose winter ecology is poorly known: wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, house martin Delichon urbicum and common swift Apus apus. Spatially segregated breeding wood warbler populations (sampled across a 800 km transect), house martins and common swifts (sampled across a 3,500 km transect) exhibited statistically identical intra-specific carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in winter grown feathers. Such patterns are compatible with a high degree of migratory connectivity, but could arise if species use isotopically similar resources at different locations. Wood warbler carbon isotope ratios are more depleted than typical for African-Eurasian migrants and are compatible with use of moist lowland forest. The very limited variance in these ratios indicates specialisation on isotopically restricted resources, which may drive the similarity in wood warbler populations' stable isotope ratios and increase susceptibility to environmental change within its wintering grounds. House martins were previously considered to primarily use moist montane forest during the winter, but this seems unlikely given the enriched nature of their carbon isotope ratios. House martins use a narrower isotopic range of resources than the common swift, indicative of increased specialisation or a relatively limited wintering range; both factors could increase house martins' vulnerability to environmental change. The marked variance in isotope ratios within each common swift population contributes to the lack of population specific signatures and indicates that the species is less vulnerable to environmental change in sub-Saharan Africa than our other focal species. Our findings demonstrate how stable isotope research can contribute to understanding avian migrants' winter ecology and conservation status. \textcopyright{} 2012 Evans et al.}

Higher lytic virus activity was recorded in the more productive sub-Antarctic zone than in the iron-limited waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during two transects. Reduced lytic viral activity in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was combined with a shift toward lysogenic infection, probably resulting from the lower concentration of potential prokaryotic hosts. Superimposed on this variation, lytic viral production was lower in a transect completed in the Drake Passage in autumn (1.8 \texttimes{} 10(8) to 1.5 \texttimes{} 10(9) liter(-1) day(-1)) than over the Greenwich Meridian during summer (5.1 \texttimes{} 10(8) to 2.0 \texttimes{} 10(10) cells liter(-1) day(-1)), indicating that viral activity is linked to the overall seasonal fluctuations in biotic activity. Interestingly, while prokaryotic abundance was lowest in the coastal Weddell Sea, levels of bacterial and lytic viral production (4.3 \texttimes{} 10(8) to 1.7 \texttimes{} 10(10) cells liter(-1) day(-1)) in this area were similar to those of the other zones. This may explain the weak relationship between the distribution of prokaryotes and chlorophyll in the Weddell Sea, as a high turnover of prokaryotic biomass may have been stimulated by the availability of substrates in the form of viral lysate. With estimated carbon and iron releases of 0.02 to 7.5 {$\mu$}g liter(-1) day(-1) and 1.5 to 175.7 pg liter(-1) day(-1), respectively, viral activity in the Southern Ocean is shown to be a major contributor to satisfying the elemental requirements of microbes, notably prokaryotes in the Weddell Sea and phytoplankton in the sub-Antarctic zone.},

  abstract = {Declines in genetic diversity within a species can affect the stability and functioning of populations. The conservation of genetic diversity is thus a priority, especially for threatened or endangered species. The importance of genetic variation, however, is dependent on the degree to which it translates into phenotypic variation for traits that affect individual performance and ecological processes. This is especially important for predominantly clonal species, as no single clone is likely to maximise all aspects of performance. Here we show that intraspecific genotypic diversity as measured using microsatellites is a strong predictor of phenotypic variation in morphological traits and shoot productivity of the threatened, predominantly clonal seagrass Posidonia australis, on the east coast of Australia. Biomass and surface area variation was most strongly predicted by genotypic richness, while variation in leaf chemistry (phenolics and nitrogen) was unrelated to genotypic richness. Genotypic richness did not predict tissue loss to herbivores or epiphyte load, however we did find that increased herbivore damage was positively correlated with allelic richness. Although there was no clear relationship between higher primary productivity and genotypic richness, variation in shoot productivity within a meadow was significantly greater in more genotypically diverse meadows. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by environmental conditions varied among different genotypes, and there was generally no variation in phenotypic traits among genotypes present in the same meadows. Our results show that genotypic richness as measured through the use of presumably neutral DNA markers does covary with phenotypic variation in functionally relevant traits such as leaf morphology and shoot productivity. The remarkably long lifespan of individual Posidonia plants suggests that plasticity within genotypes has played an important role in the longevity of the species. However, the strong link between genotypic and phenotypic variation suggests that a range of genotypes is still the best case scenario for adaptation to and recovery from predicted environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2016 Evans et al.},

  abstract = {Chromatic adaptation (CA) in cyanobacteria has provided a model system for the study of the environmental control of photophysiology for several decades. All forms of CA that have been examined so far (types II and III) involve changes in the relative contents of phycoerythrin (PE) and/or phycocyanin when cells are shifted from red to green light and vice versa. However, the chromophore compositions of these polypeptides are not altered. Some marine Synechococcus species strains, which possess two PE forms (PEI and PEII), carry out another type of CA (type IV), occurring during shifts from blue to green or white light. Two chromatically adapting strains of marine Synechococcus recently isolated from the Gulf of Mexico were utilized to elucidate the mechanism of type IV CA. During this process, no change in the relative contents of PEI and PEII was observed. Instead, the ratio of the two chromophores bound to PEII, phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin, is high under blue light and low under white light. Mass spectroscopy analyses of isolated PEII alpha- and beta-subunits show that there is a single PEII protein type under all light climates. The CA process seems to specifically affect the chromophorylation of the PEII (and possibly PEI) alpha chain. We propose a likely process for type IV CA, which involves the enzymatic activity of one or several phycobilin lyases and/or lyase-isomerases differentially controlled by the ambient light quality. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene confirm that type IV CA is not limited to a single clade of marine Synechococcus.},

Mediation of extracellular signals and regulation of cellular response to environmental stress is a key function of cellular protein kinases. Expression, proteolytical cleavage and phosphorylation of stress-responsive KRS\textsubscript{S}D protein kinase, in control and tributyl-tin (TBT) treated sponges were investigated. In control sponge, two KRS\textsubscript{S}D proteins were expressed: KRS\textsubscript{S}D1 (54 kDa) corresponding to KRS\textsubscript{S}D calculated molecular weight, and KRS\textsubscript{S}D2 (50 kDa). Exposure of sponges to TBT resulted in alteration of KRS\textsubscript{S}D1 and KRS\textsubscript{S}D2 expression levels and their phosphorylation state. KRS\textsubscript{S}D1 band disappearance after 4 h coincides with the appearance of additional 35 kDa immunoreactive protein band (p35) and decrease in number of viable cells. Incubation of recombinant KRS\textsubscript{S}D with protein extracts from TBT stressed sponges resulted in cleavage of recombinant KRS\textsubscript{S}D protein. The size of the resulting protein fragment suggests caspase-3 recognition site, present in both recombinant KRS\textsubscript{S}D and KRS\textsubscript{S}D, as a possible site of cleavage. Phosphorylated KRS\textsubscript{S}D bands appear at the same time as p35 and remain after p35 band intensity reached control level. KRS\textsubscript{S}D induction, its phosphorylation and proteolytical cleavage during TBT stress suggest that in sponge cells exist mechanism similar to one present in human cells where KRS/MST protein kinase is involved in promotion of apoptosis following oxidative stress. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Dramatic and significant changes in the lower food web, such as the loss of the spring diatom bloom, large declines in phytoplankton productivity, and a decline of Mysis populations, were directly or indirectly attributed to the expansion of Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. Total phosphorus concentrations and loadings also have decreased in the last 20. years. Changes in the Lake Michigan ecosystem induced by D. r. bugensis have produced conditions in the offshore pelagic region that are similar to oligotrophic Lake Superior. The future state of the lower food web in southern Lake Michigan is difficult to predict, mainly because population trends of D.r. bugensis in cold, offshore regions are unknown. Hence, monitoring programs designed to collect long-term, consistent data on the lower food web of Lake Michigan are essential. ?? 2010.},

  abstract = {The complexity of ecosystems is staggering, with hundreds or thousands of species interacting in a number of ways from competition and predation to facilitation and mutualism. Understanding the networks that form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes. However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly, knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study, we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of about 60\% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate of 5\%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39 European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and stability of ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Large-scale mortality of marine invertebrates is a major global concern for ocean ecosystems and many sessile, reef-building animals, such as sponges and corals, are experiencing significant declines through temperature-induced disease and bleaching. The health and survival of marine invertebrates is often dependent on intimate symbiotic associations with complex microbial communities, yet we have a very limited understanding of the detailed biology and ecology of both the host and the symbiont community in response to environmental stressors, such as elevated seawater temperatures. Here, we use the ecologically important sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile as a model to explore the changes in symbiosis during the development of temperature-induced necrosis. Expression profiling of the sponge host was examined in conjunction with the phylogenetic and functional structure and the expression profile of the symbiont community. Elevated temperature causes an immediate stress response in both the host and symbiont community, including reduced expression of functions that mediate their partnership. Disruption to nutritional interdependence and molecular interactions during early heat stress further destabilizes the holobiont, ultimately leading to the loss of archetypal sponge symbionts and the introduction of new microorganisms that have functional and expression profiles consistent with a scavenging lifestyle, a lack virulence functions and a high growth rate. Previous models have postulated various mechanisms of mortality and disease in marine invertebrates. Our study suggests that interruption of symbiotic interactions is a major determinant for mortality in marine sessile invertebrates. High symbiont specialization and low functional redundancy, thus make these holobionts extremely vulnerable to environmental perturbations, including climate change.},

  abstract = {Food web structure of the macroplankton/micronekton fauna on the continental slope of the Catalan Sea (Balearic basin, NW Mediterranean) was investigated using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracers on a total of 34 taxa. Samples were collected close to Barcelona, Spain, on the middle slope, at a seasonal scale. Mean ??13C values ranged from ??22.1??? (Salpa maxima) to ??16.9??? (the mysid Eucopia hanseni). Values of ??15N ranged from 2.5??? (the hyperiid Vibilia armata) to 9.8??? (the pelagic polychaete Tomopteris sp.). The stable isotope ratios of this fauna displayed a continuum of values over the ??15N range of 7???, confirming a wide spectrum of feeding strategies (from filter feeders to predators). High annual mean ??15N values were found among carnivorous large zooplankton and micronekton, including species that prey on gelatinous plankton (i.e. salps, siphonophores), euphausiids, natantian decapod crustaceans and fish (i.e. myctophids and stomiiformes). In agreement with the available information on diets of planktonic taxa, the lowest isotope ratios were found for filter feeders (V. armata, S. maxima, the pteropods Cymbulia peroni and Cavolinia inflexa, ostracods and the thaliacean Pyrosoma atlanticum), all of which feed on particulate organic matter. We found three trophic levels in macroplankton/micronekton food webs based on a 15N-enrichment factor of {$\sim$}2.5??? per level. The range of ??13C was particularly wide among carnivores (??20.7??? to ??16.6???), suggesting predation on a variety of prey from gelatinous zooplankton (which displayed more depleted ??13C signatures) to small fishes and decapods. Correlation between ??13C-??15N was generally weak, likely due to the consumption of different kinds of sinking particles (e.g. marine snow, phytodetritus), some constituted of multiply recycled particulate organic matter (POM). However, higher ??13C-??15N correlations were observed during winter and spring, periods of water column homogenization, suggesting that the planktonic community assimilates pulses of new production from the photic zone (peaking in January-February). Low correlations were observed during periods of water column stratification, particularly in summer, when production is especially low, suggesting that in this period macroplankton-micronekton community rely on sources other than surface primary production such as POM derived from river discharge. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

How these global changes impact the important roles of decalcifying organisms (bioeroders) in the regulation of carbonate budgets, however, is less understood. To address this important question, the effects of a range of past, present and future CO2 emission scenarios (temperature + acidification) on the excavating sponge Cliona orientalis Thiele, 1900 were explored over 12 weeks in early summer on the southern Great Barrier Reef. C. orientalis is a widely distributed bioeroder on many reefs, and hosts symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Our results showed that biomass production and bioerosion rates of C. orientalis were similar under a pre-industrial scenario and a present day (control) scenario. Symbiodinium population density in the sponge tissue was the highest under the pre-industrial scenario, and decreased towards the two future scenarios with sponge replicates under the 'business-as-usual' CO2 emission scenario exhibiting strong bleaching. Despite these changes, biomass production and the ability of the sponge to erode coral carbonate materials both increased under the future scenarios. Our study suggests that C. orientalis will likely grow faster and have higher bioerosion rates in a high CO2 future than at present, even with significant bleaching. Assuming that our findings hold for excavating sponges in general, increased sponge biomass coupled with accelerated bioerosion may push coral reefs towards net erosion and negative carbonate budgets in the future.},

However, this conclusion clearly depends on the ability of the investigated bioeroding organisms to survive and grow in the warmer and more acidic future environments, which remains unexplored. The excavating sponge Cliona orientalis Thiele, is a widely distributed bioeroding organism and symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Using C. orientalis, an energy budget model was developed to calculate amounts of carbon directed into metabolic maintenance and growth. This model was tested under a range of CO2 emission scenarios (temperature + pCO2) appropriate to an Austral early summer. Under a pre-industrial scenario, present day (control) scenario, or B1 future scenario (associated with reducing the rate of CO2 emissions over the next few decades), C. orientalis maintained a positive energy budget, where metabolic demand was likely satisfied by autotrophic carbon provided by Symbiodinium and heterotrophic carbon via filter-feeding, suggesting sustainability. Under B1, C. orientalis likely benefited by a greater supply of photosynthetic products from its symbionts, which increased by up to 56\% per unit area, and displayed an improved condition with up to 52\% increased surplus carbon available for growth. Under an A1FI future scenario (associated with `business-as-usual' CO2 emissions) bleached C. orientalis experienced the highest metabolic demand, but carbon acquired was insufficient to maintain the sponge, as indicated by a negative energy budget. These metabolic considerations suggest that previous observations of increased bioerosion under A1FI by C. orientalis may not last through the height of future A1FI summers, and survival of individual sponges may be dependent on the energy reserves (biomass) they have accumulated through the rest of the year.},

To better under- stand the factors controlling their biogeography, a reference database of the high-resolution taxonomic marker petB, encoding cytochrome b6, was used to recruit reads out of 109 metagenomes from the Tara Oceans expedition. An unsuspected novel genetic diversity was unveiled within both genera, even for the most abundant and well-characterized clades, and 136 divergent petB sequences were successfully assembled from metagenomic reads, significantly enriching the reference database. We then defined Ecologically Sig- nificant Taxonomic Units (ESTUs)\textemdash that is, organisms belonging to the same clade and occupying a common oceanic niche. Three major ESTU assemblages were identified along the cruise transect for Prochlorococcus and eight for Synechococcus.Although Prochlorococcus HLIIIA and HLIVA ESTUs codominated in iron- depleted areas of the Pacific Ocean, CRD1 and the yet-to-be cul- tured EnvB were the prevalent Synechococcus clades in this area, with three different CRD1 and EnvB ESTUs occupying distinct eco- logical niches with regard to iron availability and temperature. Sharp community shifts were also observed over short geographic distances\textemdash for example, around the Marquesas Islands or between southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans\textemdash pointing to a tight correla- tion between ESTU assemblages and specific physico-chemical pa- rameters. Together, this study demonstrates that there is a previously overlooked, ecologically meaningful, fine-scale diver- sity within some currently defined picocyanobacterial ecotypes, bringing novel insights into the ecology, diversity, and biology of the two most abundant phototrophs on Earth.},

  abstract = {Many organisms use cues to decide whether to disperse or not, especially those related to the composition of their environment. Dispersal hence sometimes depends on population density, which can be important for the dynamics and evolution of sub-divided populations. But very little is known about the factors that organisms use to inform their dispersal decision. We investigated the cues underlying density-dependent dispersal in inter-connected microcosms of the freshwater protozoan Paramecium caudatum. In two experiments, we manipulated (i) the number of cells per microcosm and (ii) the origin of their culture medium (supernatant from high- or low-density populations). We found a negative relationship between population density and rates of dispersal, suggesting the use of physical cues. There was no significant effect of culture medium origin on dispersal and thus no support for chemical cues usage. These results suggest that the perception of density - and as a result, the decision to disperse - in this organism can be based on physical factors. This type of quorum sensing may be an adaptation optimizing small scale monitoring of the environment and swarm formation in open water. \textcopyright{} 2012 Fellous et al.},

  abstract = {The ecologically and socio-economically important marine ecosystems of Europe are facing severe threats from a variety of human impacts. To mitigate and potentially reverse some of these impacts, the European Union (EU) has mandated the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in order to achieve . Good Environmental Status (GES) in EU waters by 2020. The primary initiative for achieving GES is the implementation of coherent networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Marine reserves are an important type of MPA in which no extraction is allowed, but their usefulness depends upon a number of ecological, management, and political factors. This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological effects of existing European marine reserves and the factors (social and ecological) underlying their effectiveness. Results show that existing European marine reserves foster significant positive increases in key biological variables (density, biomass, body size, and species richness) compared with areas receiving less protection, a pattern mirrored by marine reserves around the globe. For marine reserves to achieve their ecological and social goals, however, they must be designed, managed, and enforced properly. In addition, identifying whether protected areas are ecologically connected as a network, as well as where new MPAs should be established according to the MSFD, requires information on the connectivity of populations across large areas. The adoption of the MSFD demonstrates willingness to achieve the long-term protection of Europe's marine ecosystems, but whether the political will (local, regional, and continent wide) is strong enough to see its mandates through remains to be seen. Although the MSFD does not explicitly require marine reserves, an important step towards the protection of Europe's marine ecosystems is the establishment of marine reserves within wider-use MPAs as connected networks across large spatial scales. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, it is still unknown if this pattern may result from the effect of experimental temperature. Here we test whether temperature affects the unimodal size scaling pattern of phytoplankton growth by (1) growing Synechococcus sp., Ostreococcus tauri, Micromonas commoda and Pavlova lutheri at 18 \textdegree C and 25 \textdegree C, and (2) using thermal response curves available in the literature to estimate the growth rate at 25 \textdegree C as well as the maximum growth rate at optimal temperature for 22 species assayed previously at 18 \textdegree C. We also assess the sensitivity of growth rate estimates to the metric employed for measuring standing stocks, by calculating growth rates based on in vivo fluorescence, chlorophyll a concentration, cell abundance and biomass (particulate organic carbon and nitrogen content). Our results show that the unimodal size scaling pattern of phytoplankton growth, with a peak at intermediate cell sizes, is observed at 18 \textdegree C, 25 \textdegree C and at the optimal temperature for growth, and that it prevails irrespective of the standing-stock metric used. The unimodal size scaling pattern of phytoplankton growth is supported by two independent field observations reported in the literature: (i) a positive relationship between cell size and metabolic rate in the picophytoplankton size range and (ii) the dominance of intermediate-size cells in nutrient-rich waters during blooms.},

A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.},

Four leaf traits were measured from eight herbaceous species common to all 18 sites. Intraspecific trait variability differed significantly depending on site and herbivory. However, the amount and structure of variability depended on the trait measured and whether considering leaf traits separately or multiple leaf traits simultaneously. Leaf phosphorus concentration showed the highest intraspecific variability, while specific leaf area showed the highest interspecific variability and displayed intraspecific variability only in response to herbivore exclusion. Species identity based on multiple traits was not predictable. We find intraspecific variability is an essential consideration when using plant functional traits as a common currency not just species mean traits. This is particularly true for leaf nutrient concentrations, which showed high intraspecific variability in response to site differences and herbivore exclusion, a finding which suggests that the robustness assumption does not always hold.},

However, most efforts to model the response of species to climate change ignore intraspecific variation due to local adaptation. Here, we present a new perspective on spatial modelling of organism-environment relationships that combines genomic data and community-level modelling to develop scenarios regarding the geographic distribution of genomic variation in response to environmental change. Rather than modelling species within communities, we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes. Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), suggesting that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature. We also demonstrate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in the genetic composition of populations under current and future climates. Community-level modelling of genomic variation represents an important advance in landscape genomics and spatial modelling of biodiversity that moves beyond species-level assessments of climate change vulnerability. \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

  abstract = {Background: Considerable attention has focused on how selection on dispersal and other core life-history strategies (reproductive effort, survival ability, colonization capacity) may lead to so-called dispersal syndromes. Studies on genetic variation in these syndromes within species could importantly increase our understanding of their evolution, by revealing whether traits co-vary across genetic lineages in the manner predicted by theoretical models, and by stimulating further hypotheses for experimental testing. Yet such studies remain scarce. Here we studied the ciliated protist Tetrahymena thermophila, a particularly interesting organism due to cells being able to transform into morphs differing dramatically in swim-speed. We investigated dispersal, morphological responses, reproductive performance, and survival in ten different clonal strains. Then, we examined whether life history traits co-varied in the manner classically predicted for ruderal species, examined the investment of different strains into short- and putative long-distance dispersal, while considering also the likely impact of semi-sociality (cell aggregation, secretion of 'growth factors') on dispersal strategies. Results: Very significant among-strain differences were found with regard to dispersal rate, morphological commitment and plasticity, and almost all core life-history traits (e.g. survival, growth performance and strategy), with most of these traits being significantly intercorrelated. Some strains showed high short-distance dispersal rates, high colonization capacity, bigger cell size, elevated growth performance, and good survival abilities. These well performing strains, however, produced fewer fast-swimming dispersal morphs when subjected to environmental degradation than did philopatric strains performing poorly under normal conditions. Conclusion: Strong evidence was found for a genetic covariation between dispersal strategies and core life history traits in T. thermophila, with a fair fit of observed trait associations with classic colonizer models. However, the well performing strains with high colonization success and short-distance dispersal likely suffered under a long-distance dispersal disadvantage, due to producing fewer fast-swimming dispersal morphs than did philopatric strains. The smaller cell size at carrying capacity of the latter strains and their poor capacity to colonize as individual cells suggest that they may be adapted to greater levels of dependency on clone-mates (stronger sociality). In summary, differential exposure to selection on competitive and cooperative abilities, in conjunction with selective factors targeting specifically dispersal distance,},

  abstract = {Contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals and pesticides can cause direct toxic effects when released into aquatic environments. Sensitive species may be impaired by sublethal effects or decimated by lethality, and this ecological alteration may initiate a trophic cascade or a release from competition that secondarily leads to responses in tolerant species. Contaminants may exert direct effects on keystone facilitator and foundation species, and contaminant-induced changes in nutrient and oxygen dynamics may alter ecosystem function. Thus, populations and communities in nature may be directly and/or indirectly affected by exposure to pollutants. While the direct effects of toxicants usually reduce organism abundance, indirect effects may lead to increased or decreased abundance. Here we review 150 papers that reference indirect toxicant effects in aquatic environments. Studies of accidental contaminant release, chronic contamination and experimental manipulations have identified indirect contaminant effects in pelagic and benthic communities caused by many types of pollutants. Contaminant-induced changes in behavior, competition and predation/grazing rate can alter species abundances or community composition, and enhance, mask or spuriously indicate direct contaminant effects. Trophic cascades were found in 60\% of the manipulative studies and, most commonly, primary producers increased in abundance when grazers were selectively eliminated by contaminants. Competitive release may also be common, but is difficult to distinguish from trophic cascades because few experiments are designed to isolate the mechanism(s) causing indirect effects. Indirect contaminant effects may have profound implications in environments with strong trophic cascades such as the freshwater pelagic. In spite of their undesirable environmental influence, contaminants can be useful manipulative tools for the study of trophic and competitive interactions in natural communities. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Increasing levels of environmental stress due to global warming and eutrophication, and concerns about an unparalleled global diversity loss, have triggered new interest in the question whether the stability of ecosystem properties depends on population dynamics of dominant species or on compensatory growth of rare species. Recent meta-analyses suggest that compensatory dynamics are rare in natural systems. Experimental results, however, indicate that the interdependence of stressor regime, species traits, and species richness determines which mechanisms stabilise communities. Stability will depend on population dynamics of dominant species, if they remain the best performers regardless of disturbance. If dominant species become rare or lost, compensatory growth of rare species will insure natural communities against complete failure. Salinity is an important stressor governing growth and distribution of phytoplankton in brackish ecosystems, and its impact on coastal aquatic ecosystems is likely to change due to global warming. We performed two short-term experiments to investigate the effects of salinity stress on community structure and biomass production of natural phytoplankton communities collected in tidally influenced and polymictic Lake Waihola (New Zealand). The lake was brackish when the inoculum for the first experiment was collected. The inoculum for the second experiment originated from a fresh water situation. In both experiments, the phytoplankton assemblage was exposed to a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 5. To assess the importance of dominance and compensatory growth, we determined biomass production, species richness, diversity, evenness and dominance indices, and species specific growth rates.Biomass production in our experiments was determined by dominant species. Anabaena flos-aquae dominated in the first experiment, and Asterionella formosa in the second experiment. Despite the importance of these species, we found significant growth responses of rare and abundant species. Even if these species showed high growth rates, biomass production was carried by the dominant species as long as the salinity level allowed them to grow. When the salinity level was detrimental to the growth of the dominant species, reduced dominance and increased diversity indices emphasised the importance of compensatory growth of rare species. The salinity stress applied in our experiments was strong enough to change the hierarchy of successful functional traits, which affected community structure and biomass production of the plankton communities. If the predicted sea water rise, increasing frequency of storm tides, rising water temperatures, and altered precipitation and run-off cause the salinity of coastal aquatic ecosystems to change, major changes in community composition, diversity and dominance structure of planktonic primary producers might be expected. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions.

  abstract = {The classic portrayal of plankton is dominated by phytoplanktonic primary producers and zooplanktonic secondary producers. In reality, many if not most plankton traditionally labelled as phytoplankton or microzooplankton should be identified as mixotrophs, contributing to both primary and secondary production. Mixotrophic protists (i.e. single-celled eukaryotes that perform photosynthesis and graze on particles) do not represent a minor component of the plankton, as some form of inferior representatives of the past evolution of protists; they represent a major component of the extant protist plankton, and one which could become more dominant with climate change. The implications for this mistaken identification, of the incorrect labelling of mixotrophs as ``phytoplankton'' or ``microzooplankton'', are great. It extends from the (mis)use of photopigments as indicators of primary production performed by strict photoautotrophs rather than also (co)locating mixotrophic activity, through to the inadequacy of plankton functional type descriptions in models (noting that mixotrophic production in the individual organism is not a simple sum of phototrophy and heterotrophy). We propose that mixotrophy should be recognized as a major contributor to plankton dynamics, with due effort expended in field and laboratory studies, and should no longer be side-lined in conceptual food webs or in mathematical models.},

Model predictions were compared to empirical results of laboratory experiments measuring interactions among thermal stress, toxin exposure, and low food on reproduction and survival of two species of cladoceran zooplankton. Stress was defined operationally as a reduction in reproduction or survival relative to optimal conditions over a 7-d period. These experiments are particularly applicable to episodic stresses such as those associated with short-term heat waves. Toxin or low food in combination with 30C temperatures were generally more harmful than high temperature alone. However, most multiple stress effects were antagonistic, in that effects in combination were not as severe as predicted based on the sum or the product of their individual effects. In rare cases, interaction among stressors even diminished effects of the worst single stressor. Optimal conditions for reproduction and survival occurred at 25C, high food and 0 mg liter-1 toxin (a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate).

  abstract = {Ecological communities are subjected to multiple anthropogenic stressors at both global and local scales that are increasing in number and magnitude. Stressors can interact in complex ways and are classified as additive, synergistic or antagonistic; the nature of the interaction is key to predicting changes and understanding community resilience. Coral reefs are among the most impacted communities and have shifted from coral- to algal-dominated states, and overfishing, nutrient enrichment and sedimentation are local stressors that often co-occur and may support degraded algal states. Short algal turfs are abundant benthic space holders on healthy reefs that may be pushed by local stressors to long algal turfs, a more degraded state that may prevent recovery to coral dominance. We conducted a fully crossed three-factor field experiment on short algal turf communities manipulating herbivory pressure (+/-cages), nutrients (+/-fertilizer) and sediments (natural accumulation/removal). We applied stressors for 16 days, removed them and monitored turf height during and after manipulations. We found that significant pair-wise interactions between all stressors pushed the community towards a degraded state with longer algal turfs. All three types of interactions (additive, synergistic and antagonistic) were common and occurred in equal frequency, suggesting more investigations into all types are needed to accurately predict community responses to multiple stressors. For example, when herbivores were present, nutrients and sediments interacted additively, while in the absence of herbivores, nutrients and sediments interacted synergistically. All interactions broke down following termination of experimental manipulations and all effects were undetectable after 49 days, indicating that this reef may be resilient, at least when stressors are applied on a short time-scale. Synthesis. Because management of local stressors is often more tractable than global stressors, local management has been proposed as a means to offset global stressors. However, ecological communities often experience multiple local stressors simultaneously, and interactions between stressors, including synergisms and antagonisms, may be the source of nonlinear shifts in communities or ``ecological surprises.'' The majority of interactions in our study were both strong and nonlinear, and we suggest that, if pervasive across systems, nonlinear interactions may drive the recent global increase in ``ecological surprises.''.},

Using phytoplankton data obtained from 28 lakes sampled at different spatial and temporal scales, we found that the diversity in individual-level morphophysiological traits strongly improved our ability to predict community resource-use and biomass yield. Trait evenness[mdash]the regularity in distribution of individual cells/colonies within the trait space[mdash]was the strongest predictor, exhibiting a robust negative relationship across scales. Our study suggests that quantifying individual microbial phenotypes in trait space may help us understand how to link physiology to ecosystem-scale processes. Elucidating the mechanisms scaling individual-level trait variation to microbial community dynamics could there improve our ability to forecast changes in ecosystem properties across environmental gradients.},

There are inequalities that bound each norm in terms of the others. The chapter develops properties of the 2-norm, since it is most frequently used in applications. In particular, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the Pythagorean theorem are satisfied by the 2-norm. The 2-norm is orthogonally invariant and thus is very important in computer graphics. If a set of k vectors in n-dimensional space are orthogonal, they form a basis for a k-dimensional subspace. Multiplication by an orthogonal matrix effects a change of coordinates. Spherical coordinates are introduced, and an orthogonal matrix is developed to change to and from Euclidean coordinates and spherical coordinates. The spherical coordinate basis vectors are the columns of the orthogonal matrix. The chapter defines the matrix norm and first presents the Frobenius norm. The induced matrix norm is defined, and the unit spheres for the infinity, 1- and 2- norm vector norms are drawn. The value of an induced matrix norm is the maximum value of Ax for x on the unit sphere. The infinity norm of a matrix is developed both experimentally and mathematically. The submultiplicative property for matrix norms is defined and it is shown that the Frobenius norm is submultiplicative. The 2-norm is the most complicated norm to compute. Begin with the symmetric matrix ATA whose eigenvalues are nonnegative. A singular value is the square root of an eigenvalue of ATA. Using the spectral theorem, it is shown that the matrix 2-norm is the largest singular value. Important properties of the 2-norm are developed, including orthogonal invariance, the fact that the 2-norm of a matrix equals the 2-norm of its transpose, and that the 2-norm of the inverse of A is the reciprocal of the smallest singular value of A.},

The question of how among-individual variation influences the performance of populations and species is a poorly explored but currently growing field of research. Here, we review 31 experimental and 14 comparative studies and first investigate whether there is empirical support for the propositions that higher levels of among-individual phenotypic and genetic variation promote the ecological and evolutionary success of populations and species in the face of environmental change. Next, we examine whether and how the effect of diversity depends on environmental conditions. Finally, we explore whether the relationship linking population fitness to diversity is typically linear, asymptotic, or whether the benefits peak at intermediate diversity. The reviewed studies provide strong, almost invariable, evidence that more variable populations are less vulnerable to environmental changes, show decreased fluctuations in population size, have superior establishment success, larger distribution ranges, and are less extinction prone, compared with less variable populations or species. Given the overwhelming evidence that variation promotes population performance, it is important to identify conditions when increased variation does not have the theoretically expected effect, a question of considerable importance in biodiversity management, where there are many other practical constraints. We find that experimental outcomes generally support the notion that genetic and phenotypic variation is of greater importance under more stressful than under benign conditions. Finally, population performance increased linearly with increasing diversity in the majority (10 of 12) of manipulation studies that included four or more diversity levels; only two experiments detected curvilinear relationships.},

We determined relations between species' root trait values and their plasticity and response to P and/or water stress in terms of total biomass production and stress intensity.Results showed that mycorrhizal rates were negatively related to biomass production in the four growth conditions. Long root hairs and high aerenchyma production were associated with high biomass production in growth conditions without and with P stress, respectively. Species with acquisitive strategies (high SRL) were less impacted by P and water stress than those with conservative ones (low SRL). Additionally, increased SRL and root hair length decreased the impact of P stress on species' performances.Results showed that grassland Fabaceae display a wide range of root functional strategies (. i.e. root functional trait attributes and plasticity), which explain their performances under P and/or water shortage.},

Direct density dependence generated by intraspecific competition and/or predator-prey interactions should buffer environmentally produced changes in density-independent growth rates (r). Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3. We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney \& McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls. Two experiments used predator-prey pairs (Didinium nasutum M\"uller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4. Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200\%. Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5. The results suggest that natural populations, regulated by direct density dependence, may be buffered against directional environmental change. Environmental change will have large effects when populations experience little density dependence, and when environmental change has different effects on the vital rates of different species.},

In birds, colour polymorphism has been related to alternative behavioural strategies, potentially underlying different responses to extreme environmental conditions between colour morphs. Here, we examined how red- and black-headed Gouldian finches, Erythrura gouldiae, responded to experimentally induced heatwaves of different intensities by measuring their feeding behaviour, their response to novelty and their behavioural reactivity. As red-headed birds have been described as physiologically more plastic than black-headed birds, we expected them to alter their behaviour more strongly in response to heatwaves. Even though black-headed males fed overall less than other birds (thereby suggesting lower energy requirements), differences in feeding behaviour between morphs remained unaffected by thermal conditions. However, birds' response to novelty varied between morphs under variable thermal conditions. Indeed, before thermal treatment, black-headed birds, irrespective of their sex, spent less time near a novel object than red-headed birds, thereby suggesting lower novelty interest. However, because only red-headed birds reduced the time spent close to a novel object during heatwaves, differences in novelty interest between morphs disappeared under these thermal conditions. These results suggest that behavioural plasticity in response to thermal conditions differ between colour morphs of Gouldian finches, thereby showing that behavioural differences between morphs are not static. How such behavioural adjustments within species affect the balance between colour morphs in natural populations facing extreme environmental conditions remains to be determined. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

  abstract = {We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.},

Tetrahymena thermophila (T. thermophila) possesses a diploid micronucleus (Mi) possessing two complete haploid genome sets and capable of both mitosis and meiosis, plus a macronucleus (Ma) that is made up of multiple copies of a rearranged subset of the complete (micronuclear) genome. The micronucleus is mostly inert transcriptionally, whereas the macronucleus is transcriptionally very active. These two nuclei exemplify an intracellular separation of germ (micronucleus) and soma (macronucleus). Tetrahymena thermophila can grow very well in a variety of axenic media, with generation times typically in the 2\textendash 3 hr range and optimally 1.4 hr. When fed with bacteria or grown on peptone-based media, single T. thermophila cells can be cloned with extremely high efficiency. However, even in otherwise optimal fully defined media, a minimal inoculum density typically is required to initiate exponential culture growth; at densities below this minimum, the cells die.},

In order to study their interactions on plant performance, growth chamber experiments were performed with plants from three origins of the common but ecologically variable Purple Moor Grass (Molinia caerulea (L.) Moench) grown in a bi-factorial combination of two levels of nutrients (for N: 31 or 62 kg ha-1 year-1) and CO2 (400 or 600 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 CO2). Plants were established from ramets with known start weights so that total biomass accumulation of each plant over time could be analysed. Plant phenology, leaf properties and the biomass of different fractions (inflorescences, leaves, stems and rootstocks) were investigated to identify treatment effects on plant development and allocation patterns. The few consistent responses identified in the plants were a significant increase in leaf biomass by doubling the nutrient supply and plants exposed to elevated CO2 showing a reduced specific leaf area (SLA), an increased number of senescent leaves and increased rootstock growth. Increasing the nutrient supply had greater effects on aboveground biomass than raising the CO2 concentrations but significant interactions between the two plant fertilisers were absent. The variable responses of the ramets to the addition of resources were largely modified by their phenology and their readiness to switch from vegetative to reproductive growth. We conclude that differences in phenology and ecological behaviour of ecotypes of the same plant species will largely affect their response to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Based on nine years of observation (2001-2009) inside and outside a well managed MPA, we assessed the potential of conservation and management actions to modify patterns of spatial and/or temporal variability of Posidonia oceanica meadows, the lower midlittoral and the shallow infralittoral rock assemblages. Significant differences in both temporal variations and spatial patterns were observed between protected and unprotected locations. A lower temporal variability in the protected vs. unprotected assemblages was found in the shall ow infralittoral, demonstrating that, at least at local scale, protection can enhance community stability. Macrobenthos with long-lived and relatively slow-growing invertebrates and structurally complex algal forms were homogeneously distributed in space and went through little fluctuations in time. In contrast, a mosaic of disturbed patches featured unprotected locations, with small-scale shifts from macroalgal stands to barrens, and harsh temporal variations between the two states. Opposite patterns of spatial and temporal variability were found for the midlittoral assemblages. Despite an overall clear pattern of seagrass regression through time, protected meadows showed a significantly higher shoot density than unprotected ones, suggesting a higher resistance to local human activities. Our results support the assumption that the exclusion/management of human activities within MPAs enhance the stability of the structural components of protected marine systems, reverting or arresting threat-induced trajectories of change. \textcopyright{} 2013 Fraschetti et al.},

Here, we explore how multiple local environmental gradients in resources required by plants (light, water, and nutrients) and soil disturbance together influence the direction and amplitude of intraspecific changes in leaf and fine root traits that facilitate capture of these resources. We measured population-level analogous above- and belowground traits related to resource acquisition, i.e. "specific leaf area"-"specific root length" (SLA-SRL), and leaf and root N, P, and dry matter content (DMC), on three dominant understory tree species with contrasting carbon and nutrient economics across 15 plots in a temperate forest influenced by burrowing seabirds. We observed similar responses of the three species to the same single environmental influences, but partially species-specific responses to combinations of influences. The strength of intraspecific above- and belowground trait responses appeared unrelated to species resource acquisition strategy. Finally, most analogous leaf and root traits (SLA vs. SRL, and leaf versus root P and DMC) were controlled by contrasting environmental influences. The decoupled responses of above- and belowground traits to these multiple environmental factors together with partially species-specific adjustments suggest complex responses of plant communities to environmental changes, and potentially contrasting feedbacks of plant traits with ecosystem properties. We demonstrate that despite the growing evidence for broadly consistent resource-acquisition strategies at the whole plant level among species, plants also show partially decoupled, finely tuned strategies between above- and belowground parts at the intraspecific level in response to their environment. This decoupling within species suggests a need for many species-centred ecological theories on how plants respond to their environments (e.g. competitive/stress-tolerant/ruderal and response-effect trait frameworks) to be adapted to account for distinct plant-environment interactions among distinct individuals of the same species and parts of the same individual. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

While both theoretical and empirical work suggest that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a function of local population density, the functional relationship between the underlying movement strategies and population density has received less attention. We here present evidence for the shape of this reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues: the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites (chemical cues) and resource availability. We performed microcosm experiments with the ciliate model organism Tetrahymena in order to understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. Our findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was U-shaped. This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative density dependence at low population densities and generally positive density dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely mediated by chemical cues. Our experimental work in highly controlled conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and dispersal.},

No extinctions occurred in eight experimental trials with reserves, whereas extinction occurred in seven of eight trials without reserves, as predicted by population viability models based on stochastic population processes.

We incubated Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus under present-day (380 ppm) or predicted year-2100 CO2 levels (750 ppm), and under normal versus elevated temperatures (+4 degrees C) in semicontinuous cultures. Increased temperature stimulated the cell division rates of Synechococcus but not Prochlorococcus. Doubled CO2 combined with elevated temperature increased maximum chl a-normalized photosynthetic rates of Synechococcus four times relative to controls. Temperature also altered other photosynthetic parameters (alpha, Phi(max), E-k, and Delta F/F-m') in Synechococcus, but these changes were not observed for Prochlorococcus. Both increased CO2 and temperature raised the phycobilin and chl a content of Synechococcus, while only elevated temperature increased divinyl chl a in Prochlorococcus. Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) quotas, but not phosphorus (P) quotas, increased with elevated CO2 in Synechococcus, leading to similar to 20\% higher C:P and N:P ratios. In contrast, Prochlorococcus elemental composition remained unaffected by CO2, but cell volume and elemental quotas doubled with increasing temperature while maintaining constant stoichiometry. Synechococcus showed a much greater response to CO2 and temperature increases for most parameters measured, compared with Prochlorococcus. Our results suggest that global change could influence the dominance of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus ecotypes, with likely effects on oligotrophic food-web structure. However, individual picocyanobacteria strains may respond quite differently to future CO2 and temperature increases, and caution is needed when generalizing their responses to global change in the ocean.},

Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured the four traits from 681 individuals across five ecological scales: lake, transect, depth stratus, quadrat and individual. A notable high trait variation (coefficient variation: 48-112\%) was observed within species. These traits differed in the spatial structure, depending on environmental factors of different scales. Shoot height and branch length were most responsive to lake, transect and depth stratus scales, while root/shoot ratio and leaf number to quadrat and individual scales. The trait variations caused by environment are nearly three times higher than that caused by ontogeny, with ontogenetic variance ranging from 21\% (leaf number) to 33\% (branch length) of total variance. Remarkably, these traits showed non-negligible ontogenetic variation (0-60\%) in each ecological scale, and significant shifts in allometric trajectories at lake and depth stratus scales. Our results highlight that environmental filtering processes can sort individuals within species with traits values adaptive to environmental changes and ontogenetic variation of functional traits was non-negligible across the five ecological scales. \textcopyright{} 2013 Fu et al.}

Bacterial cells were separated from phytoplankton and detritus with glass fiber and membrane filters (pore size, 0.8 {$\mu$}m) and then concentrated by tangential flow filtration. The concentrate was used for the determination of amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation method, and after it was stained with 4{${'}$},6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, cell abundance was determined by epifluorescence microscopy. We found that the average contents of carbon and nitrogen for oceanic bacterial assemblages were 12.4 {$\pm$} 6.3 and 2.1 {$\pm$} 1.1 fg cell-1 (mean {$\pm$} standard deviation; n = 6), respectively. Corresponding values for coastal bacterial assemblages were 30.2 {$\pm$} 12.3 fg of C cell-1 and 5.8 {$\pm$} 1.5 fg of N cell-1(n = 5), significantly higher than those for oceanic bacteria (two-tailed Student's t test; P\textexclamdown{} 0.03). There was no significant difference (P \textquestiondown{} 0.2) in the bacterial C:N ratio (atom atom-1) between oceanic (6.8 {$\pm$} 1.2) and coastal (5.9 {$\pm$} 1.1) assemblages. Our estimates support the previous proposition that bacteria contribute substantially to total biomass in marine environments, but they also suggest that the use of a single conversion factor for diverse marine environments can lead to large errors in assessing the role of bacteria in food webs and biogeochemical cycles. The use of a factor, 20 fg of C cell-1, which has been widely adopted in recent studies may result in the overestimation (by as much as 330\%) of bacterial biomass in open oceans and in the underestimation (by as much as 40\%) of bacterial biomass in coastal environments.},

However, the key members of the PPE community and hence the major routes of carbon fixation, particularly in the open ocean environment, are poorly described. Here, we have accessed PPE community structure using the plastid encoded 16S rRNA gene. Plastid 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from 65 algal cultures, about half being PPEs, representing 14 algal classes. These included sequences from 5 classes where previously no such sequences from cultured representatives had been available (Bolidophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, Pelagophyceae and Pinguiophyceae). Sequences were also obtained for 6 of the 7 (according to 18S rRNA gene sequence) prasinophyte clades. Phylogenetic analysis revealed plastids from the same class as clustering together. Using all the obtained sequences, as well as plastid sequences currently in public databases, a non-degenerate marine algal plastid-biased PCR primer, PLA491F, was developed to minimize amplification of picocyanobacteria, which often dominate numerically environmental samples. Clone libraries subsequently constructed from the pico-sized fraction from 2 open ocean sites in the Arabian Sea, revealed an abundance of 16S rRNA gene clones phylogenetically related to chrysophytes, whilst prymnesiophyte, clade II prasinophyte (Ostreococcus-like) and pelagophyte clones were also well represented. The finding of a wealth of novel clones related to the Chrysophyceae highlights the utility of a PCR biased towards marine algal plastids as a valuable complement to 18S rDNA based studies of PPE diversity.},

Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to 'road test' management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade-offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time.

Early theoretical work on eco-evolutionary dynamics was concerned with the effect of (co)evolution on the stability of two-species predator-prey systems and the occurrence of character displacement in simple competitive systems. Today's theoretical ecologists are extending this work to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multispecies communities and the functioning and evolutionary emergence of ecosystems. 3. In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics. 4. The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and that they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities.},

We deduce a direct relationship between cascades and pyramids, modulated by what we call trophic dissipation \textendash{} a synthetic concept that encodes the contribution of top-down propagation of consumer losses in the biomass pyramid. Predictable across-ecosystem patterns emerge when systems are in similar regimes of trophic dissipation.

  abstract = {The introduction of invasive species, which often differ functionally from the components of the recipient community, generates ecological impacts that propagate along the food web. This review aims to determine how consistent the impacts of aquatic invasions are across taxa and habitats. To that end, we present a global meta-analysis from 151 publications (733 cases), covering a wide range of invaders (primary producers, filter collectors, omnivores and predators), resident aquatic community components (macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) and habitats (rivers, lakes and estuaries). Our synthesis suggests a strong negative influence of invasive species on the abundance of aquatic communities, particularly macrophytes, zooplankton and fish. In contrast, there was no general evidence for a decrease in species diversity in invaded habitats, suggesting a time lag between rapid abundance changes and local extinctions. Invaded habitats showed increased water turbidity, nitrogen and organic matter concentration, which are related to the capacity of invaders to transform habitats and increase eutrophication. The expansion of invasive macrophytes caused the largest decrease in fish abundance, the filtering activity of filter collectors depleted planktonic communities, omnivores (including both facultative and obligate herbivores) were responsible for the greatest decline in macrophyte abundance, and benthic invertebrates were most negatively affected by the introduction of new predators. These impacts were relatively consistent across habitats and experimental approaches. Based on our results, we propose a framework of positive and negative links between invasive species at four trophic positions and the five different components of recipient communities. This framework incorporates both direct biotic interactions (predation, competition, grazing) and indirect changes to the water physicochemical conditions mediated by invaders (habitat alteration). Considering the strong trophic links that characterize aquatic ecosystems, this framework is relevant to anticipate the far-reaching consequences of biological invasions on the structure and functionality of aquatic ecosystems.},

In practice, however, it is unknown how effective PAs will be in shielding native species from invasions under projected climate change. Here, we investigate the current and future potential distributions of 100 of the most invasive terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species in Europe. We use this information to evaluate the combined threat posed by climate change and invasions to existing PAs and the most susceptible species they shelter. We found that only a quarter of Europe's marine and terrestrial areas protected over the last 100 years have been colonized by any of the invaders investigated, despite offering climatically suitable conditions for invasion. In addition, hotspots of invasive species and the most susceptible native species to their establishment do not match at large continental scales. Furthermore, the predicted richness of invaders is 11\%\textendash 18\% significantly lower inside PAs than outside them. Invasive species are rare in long-established national parks and nature reserves, which are actively protected and often located in remote and pristine regions with very low human density. In contrast, the richness of invasive species is high in the more recently designated Natura 2000 sites, which are subject to high human accessibility. This situation may change in the future, since our models anticipate important shifts in species ranges toward the north and east of Europe at unprecedented rates of 14\textendash 55 km/decade, depending on taxonomic group and scenario. This may seriously compromise the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the resistance that PAs provide against biological invasions and climate change on a continental scale and illustrates their strategic value in safeguarding native biodiversity.},

The cyanobacteria covered two orders of magnitude differences in size. We found that both niche and fitness differences increased with size differences. Niche differences increased faster with size differences than relative fitness differences and whereas coexisting pairs showed larger size differences than non-coexisting pairs, ultimately species coexistence could not be predicted on basis of size differences only. Our findings suggest that size is more than a key trait controlling physiological and population-level aspects of phytoplankton, it is also relevant for community-level phenomena such as niche and fitness differences which influence coexistence and biodiversity.},

However, research has developed in two opposite directions: the first, focusing on screening, utilizes phenomenological models; the second, focusing on predictions of invasion dynamics, utilizes mechanistic models. Here, we present hybrid modelling as an approach to bridge the gap and to integrate the advantages of both research directions.Location Global.Methods First, we briefly summarize the characteristics and limitations of both approaches (screening vs. understanding). Then, we review the recent developments of hybrid models, discuss their current problems and offer suggestions to improve them.Results Generally, hybrid models are able to combine the advantages of currently used phenomenological and mechanistic approaches. Main challenges in building hybrid models are the choices of the appropriate degree of detail and efficiency and the decision on how to connect the different sub-models. Given these challenges, we discuss the links between the phenomenological and the mechanistic model parameters, the underlying concepts of fundamental and realized niches and the problem of feedback loops between population dynamics and environmental factors.Main conclusions Once the above challenges have been addressed and the necessary framework has been developed, hybrid models will provide outstanding tools for overcoming past limitations and will provide the means to make reliable and robust predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species, their population dynamics and the potential outcomes of the overall invasion process.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in modern coexistence theory (MCT) have advanced our understanding of how species interactions among themselves and with the environment influence community dynamics. Although the formulation of MCT is mathematically clear, its application to empirical cases is still challenging, which precludes its adoption by a large range of ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in broad questions related to community assembly and the maintenance of species diversity. We developed cxr, an r package that provides a complete toolbox for calculating species vital rates and interaction parameters, from which the user can obtain estimates of coexistence outcomes based on stabilizing niche differences and average fitness differences. Our aim is to offer a highly versatile package to accommodate different research needs. This means that the user can define population models, use different optimization algorithms and include the effect of external covariates on species interactions, which may include environmental variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, salinity) and biotic controls (e.g. predation, pollination, mycorrhizae). To illustrate the functionality and versatility of cxr, we provide a complete set of population dynamic models and a dataset from a highly diverse grassland community. By building bridges between MCT formulation and its implementation, we provide tools to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how species interactions determine basic patterns such as species abundances and dominance, which are core information for many applied fields, such as conservation, restoration and invasion biology. Finally, the package is not limited taxonomically to any particular group. The application of tools derived from MCT to a wide range of different systems can create feedbacks between empirical and theoretical studies in a way that stimulates a better understanding of the processes maintaining biodiversity.},

Plants modify their economic strategies by adjusting functional traits in response to shifts in environmental conditions. Facilitation has been recognized as a major biotic filter of trait distribution in communities, although the effect of facilitation on intraspecific variability has been scarcely explored. We evaluated intraspecific shifts in leaf functional traits of a perennial forb (Helleborus foetidus) in relation to the presence of a nurse plant (Juniperus sabina) in two sites with contrasting abiotic stress levels. The effects of abiotic (site) and biotic (juniper presence, microsite) environments on specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area (LA), lamina/petiole length ratio (LPR), intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and leaf nutrient content (N, P and N:P) per mass were evaluated. Alleviation of drought stress associated with nurse plant presence was reflected in SLA, LA, LPR and iWUE at the high-stress site. Individuals growing in open areas showed more resource-conservative traits, supporting the argument that this strategy is advantageous in environments that limit opportunities for rapid carbon gain. Leaf nutrients were unrelated to other traits. The large amount of intraspecific variation in leaf functional traits related to facilitative processes highlights the importance of facilitation as a major source of plant trait variation. Both positive and negative biotic interactions, as well as intraspecific trait variability, should be considered in mechanistic models of plant communities' functional responses to environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

These factors are, however, most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we use high-throughput experiments with microbial communities to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities had a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enabled them to maintain productivity as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species' thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.},

Understanding the fine-scale nature of this regulation through tracking techniques can provide a better understanding of the relationships between such species and their dynamic environments. The use of animal tracking and telemetry technology has allowed the extensive collection of such data which has enabled us to better understand the ways animals move within their landscape. However, such technologies do not come without certain costs: they are generally invasive, relatively expensive, can be too heavy for small sized animals and unreliable in certain habitats. This study provides a cost-effective and non-invasive method through photo-identification, to determine fine scale movements of individuals. With our methodology, we have been able to find that male eastern water dragons (Intellagama leuseurii) have home ranges one and a half times larger than those of females. Furthermore, we found intraspecific differences in the size of home ranges depending on the time of the day. Lastly, we found that location mostly influenced females' home ranges, but not males and discuss why this may be so. Overall, we provide valuable information regarding the ecology of the eastern water dragon, but most importantly demonstrate that non-invasive photo-identification can be successfully applied to the study of reptiles. \textcopyright{} 2014 Gardiner et al.}

Whereas effects of individual environmental changes (e.g. temperature change or change in resource availability) are reasonably well understood, we lack information about if and how multiple changes interact. We examined interactions among four types of environmental disturbance (temperature, nutrient ratio, carbon enrichment, and light) in a fully factorial design using a microbial aquatic ecosystem and observed responses of dissolved oxygen saturation at three temporal scales (resistance, resilience, and return time). We tested whether multiple disturbances combine in a dominant, additive, or interactive fashion, and compared the predictability of dissolved oxygen across scales. Carbon enrichment and shading reduced oxygen concentration in the short term (i.e. resistance); although no other effects or interactions were statistically significant, resistance decreased as the number of disturbances increased. In the medium term, only enrichment accelerated recovery, but none of the other effects (including interactions) were significant. In the long term, enrichment and shading lengthened return times, and we found significant two-way synergistic interactions between disturbances. The best performing model (dominant, additive, or interactive) depended on the temporal scale of response. In the short term (i.e. for resistance), the dominance model predicted resistance of dissolved oxygen best, due to a large effect of carbon enrichment, whereas none of the models could predict the medium term (i.e. resilience).

  abstract = {One of the main objectives of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS) program is to develop an understanding of the factors controlling organic carbon production in the ocean and the time-varying vertical flux of carbon from surface waters (US JGOFS (1990) US JGOFS Planning Report Number 11; Sarmiento and Armstrong (1997) US JGOFS Synthesis and Modeling Project Implementation Plan). A considerable amount of evidence suggests that carbon cycling and the potential for exporting carbon from ocean systems is a function of food web structure. As part of the US JGOFS Arabian Sea Studies, the biomass of planktonic organisms, ranging from heterotrophic bacteria through microplankton-sized organisms, was estimated using a variety of methods including flow cytometry and microscopy. This is a first attempt to combine biomass data from a number of sources, evaluate the structure of the food web, examine changes in food web structure in relation to seasonal or spatial features of the study area, and look for indications of how changing structure affects carbon-cycling processes. Biomass in the upper 100 m of the water column ranged from approximately 1.5 to \textquestiondown 5.2 gC m-2. Heterotrophic bacteria (Hbac) made up from 16 and 44\% of the biomass; autotrophs comprised 43-64\%; and the remainder was made up of nano- and microheterotrophs. Autotrophs and nano- and microheterotrophs showed a general pattern of higher values at coastal stations, with the lowest values offshore. Heterotrophic bacteria (Hbac) showed no significant spatial variations. The Spring Intermonsoon and early NE Monsoon were dominated by autotrophic picoplankton, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The late NE Monsoon and late SW Monsoon periods showed an increase in the larger size fractions of the primary producers. At several stations during the SW Monsoon, autotrophic microplankton, primarily diatoms and Phaeocystis colonies, predominated. Increases in the size of autotrophs were also reflected in increasing sizes of nano- and microheterorophs. The biomass estimates based on cytometry and microscopy are consistent with measurement of pigments, POC and PON. Changes in community structure were assessed using the percent similarity index (PSI) in conjunction with multidimensional scaling (MDS) or single-linkage clustering analysis to show how assemblages differed among cruises and stations. Station clustering reflected environmental heterogeneity, and many of the conspicuous changes could be associated with changes in temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations. Despite inherent problems in combining data from a variety of sources, the present community biomass estimates were well constrained by bulk measurements such as Chl a, POC and PON, and by comparisons with other quantitative and qualitative studies. The most striking correlation between food web structure and carbon cycling was the dominance of large phytoplankton, primarily diatoms, and the seasonal maxima of mass flux during the SW Monsoon. High nutrient conditions associated with upwelling during the SW Monsoon would explain the predominance of diatoms during this season. The sinking of large, ungrazed diatom cells is one possible explanation for the flux observations, but may not be consistent with the observation of concurrent increases in larger microzooplankton consumers (heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates) and mesozooplankton during this season. Food-web structure during the early NE Monsoon and Intermonsoons suggests carbon cycling by the microbial community predominated.},

Recent research has found that plants can harbour significant epigenetic diversity, but its extent, stability and ecological significance in natural populations is largely unexplored. We analysed genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic variation in a large number of natural grassland populations of Plantago lanceolata, covering a broad geographical and environmental range. Within-population diversity and among-population differentiation were calculated from genetic and epigenetic marker data and from measurements of phenotypic traits, both for plants in the field and for the F 1 generation grown in a common environment. We found weak but significant epigenetic population structure. A large part of the epigenetic population differences observed in the field was maintained in a common environment. Epigenetic differences were consistently related to genetic and environmental variation, and to a lesser degree to phenotypic variation and land use, with more grazed populations harbouring greater epigenetic diversity. Our study demonstrates that epigenetic diversity exists in natural populations of a common grassland species, and that at least part of this epigenetic diversity is stable, nonrandom and related to environmental variation. Experimental and more detailed molecular studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic basis of these observed patterns. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.

The hormetic effects of ten ionic liquids (ILs), singly and in mixtures in the ratios of their individual EC(50), EC(10), EC(0), and EC(m) (maximal stimulatory effect concentration), on luciferase luminescence were determined by using microplate toxicity analysis. There was good agreement between the effects observed and predicted by concentration addition (CA) for all four mixtures. This evidence supports the use of CA model as a default approach for assessing the combined effect of chemicals at the molecular level. Focusing on the selected points of the concentration-response curves (CRCs) of mixtures, the mixtures of IL chemicals mixed at concentrations that individually showed stimulatory effects could produce inhibitory or no effects, and the mixture of IL chemicals mixed at concentrations that individually showed no effects could produce significant inhibitory effect. The three interesting phenomena in mixture hormesis may have important implications for current risk assessment practices.},

However, to date, most of the cyanobacteria\textendash zooplankton interaction studies focused on temperate regions using large generalist grazers, which rarely coexist with cyanobacteria. Here a short-term (3 h) laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the grazing rate of Thermocyclops decipiens exposed to different combinations of phytoplankton (T1\,=\,100\% Nitzschia-0\% Cylindrospermopsis, T2\,=\,75\% Nitzschia-25\% Cylindrospermopsis, T3\,=\,50\% Nitzschia-50\% Cylindrospermopsis, T4\,=\,25\% Nitzschia-75\% Cylindrospermopsis and T5\,=\,0\% Nitzschia-100\% Cylindrospermopsis). In addition, an 8-day experiment was performed to determine the effect of the diet treatments on Thermocyclops survivorship and growth. The total biomass of phytoplankton in treatments with higher proportion of Nitzschia (i.e., T1 and T2) showed abrupt decline (i.e., down to 61\% and 71\%, respectively) over time when compared to other treatments. While Thermocyclops largely excluded Cylindrospermopsis when Nitzschia is abundant, they were capable of shortening the longer filaments of Cylindrospermopsis into significantly smaller fragments and ingesting them when provided as a sole food. This, however, negatively influenced their survivorship and growth. Our results generally suggest that dominantly occurring selective grazers in tropical and warmer-temperate lakes may shift the phytoplankton community composition to favor cyanobacteria by grazing on the alternative food source, at least before the cyanobacteria becomes dominant.},

The N:P ratio of algae and cyanobacteria is very plastic in nutrient-limited cells, ranging from {$<$} 5 mol N-mol P when phosphate is available greatly in excess of nitrate or ammonium to {$>$} 100 mol N:mol P when inorganic N is present greatly in excess of P. Under optimal nutrient-replete growth conditions, the cellular N:P ratio is somewhat more constrained, ranging from 5 to 19 mol N:mol P, with most observations below the Redfield ratio of 16. Limited data indicate that the critical N:P that marks the transition between N- and P-limitation of phytoplankton growth lies in the range 20-50 mol N:mol P, considerably in excess of the Redfield ratio. Biochemical composition can be used to constrain the critical N:P. Although the biochemical data do not preclude the critical N:P from being as high as 50, the typical biochemical composition of nutrient-replete algae and cyanobacteria suggests that the critical N:P is more likely to lie in the range between 15 and 30. Despite the observation that the overall average N:P composition of marine particulate matter closely approximates the Redfield ratio of 16, there are significant local variations with a range from 5 to 34. Consistent with the culture studies, lowest values of N:P are associated with nitrate- and phosphate-replete conditions. The highest values of N:P are observed in oligotrophic waters and are within the range of critical N:P observed in cultures, but are not so high as to necessarily invoke P-limitation. The C:N ratio is also plastic. The average C:N ratios of nutrient-replete phytoplankton cultures, oceanic particulate matter and inorganic N and C draw-down are slightly greater than the Redfield ratio of 6.6. Neither the analysis of laboratory C:N:P data nor a more theoretical approach based on the relative abundance of the major biochemical molecules in the phytoplankton can support the contention that the Redfield N:P reflects a physiological or biochemical constraint on the elemental composition of primary production.},

However, few biogeochemical/ecological models explicitly include this mode of nutrition, owing to the large diversity of observed mixotrophic types, the few data allowing the parameterization of physiological processes, and the need to make the addition of mixotrophy into existing ecosystem models as simple as possible. We here propose and discuss a flexible model that depicts the main observed behaviors of mixotrophy in microplankton. A first model version describes constitutive mixotrophy (the organism photosynthesizes by use of its own chloroplasts). This model version offers two possible configurations, allowing the description of constitutive mixotrophs (CMs) that favor either phototrophy or heterotrophy. A second version describes non-constitutive mixotrophy (the organism performs phototrophy by use of chloroplasts acquired from its prey). The model variants were described so as to be consistent with a plankton conceptualization in which the biomass is divided into separate components on the basis of their biochemical function (Shuter-approach; Shuter, 1979). The two model variants of mixotrophy can easily be implemented in ecological models that adopt the Shuter-approach, such as the MIRO model (Lancelot et al., 2005), and address the challenges associated with modeling mixotrophy.},

Yet, their effectiveness in protecting marine ecosystems from global stressors is debated. Biological invasions are a major driver of global change, causing biodiversity loss and altering ecosystem functioning. Here, we explored the relationships between MPAs and alien/ native range expanding fishes in the Mediterranean Sea, the world's most invaded sea. We surveyed fish and benthic communities in nine MPAs and adjacent unprotected areas across six countries. In the South and Eastern Mediterranean MPAs, the biomass of alien and native range expanding fishes often exceeded 50\% of the total fish biomass. Conversely, in the North and Western Mediterranean, alien fishes were absent. A negative relationship was found between native and alien species richness. Average and minimum sea surface temperature (SST) over six consecutive years were positively correlated with the total biomass of alien species; no alien fishes were recorded below 20.5 \textdegree C average SST and 13.8\textdegree{} C minimum SST. We also found a negative relationship between alien fishes' biomass and the distance from the Suez Canal which is the main pathway for the introduction of alien fish in the Mediterranean Sea. The biomass of alien and native range expanding fishes was found to be higher in the South and Eastern Mediterranean MPAs than in adjacent unprotected areas. The association of barrens (rocky reefs deprived of vegetation) and invasive herbivores was observed at all eastern sites, regardless of protection status. Currently, the level of fishing pressure exerted on alien and native range expanding fishes seems to be the most influential factor determining the lower biomass of invasive fishes at unprotected sites compared to MPAs. Our findings suggest that complementary management actions, such as species-targeted removals, should be taken in MPAs in order to control invasive fish populations.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This article is protected by copyright.

Although this is perhaps to be expected given the diversity of potential drivers, the debate has not been helped by a general lack of rigorous data and loose definitions. There is a need for the community to refocus its attention on understanding the implications of jellyfish blooms and managing them, because regardless of global trends, jellyfish are a problem in some coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we provide recommendations for advancing jellyfish research. These include directing research toward better managing jellyfish impacts, expanding research into socio-economic consequences to grow the money available for research, building more operational and ecosystem models for tactical and strategic management, filling in the gaps in our biological knowledge for supporting models, improving surveillance using observing systems and making jellyfish research more rigorous. Some vehicles to address these recommendations include international standardization of methods, a discipline-specific journal for jellyfish research and an international science program on the global ecology and oceanography of jellyfish.},

We incorporated nonheritable variation in attack rates and handling times into a classical consumer-resource model to investigate how variation may alter interaction strengths, population dynamics, species persistence, and invasiveness. We found that individual variation influences species persistence through its effect on interaction strengths. In many scenarios, interaction strengths decrease with variation, which in turn affects species coexistence and stability. Because environmental change alters the direction and strength of selection acting upon phenotypic traits, our results have implications for species coexistence in a context of habitat fragmentation, climate change, and the arrival of exotic species to native ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Understanding how food webs will respond to globally rising temperatures is a pressing issue. Temperature effects on food webs are likely underpinned by differences in the thermal sensitivity of consumers and resources, or thermal asymmetries. We identify three sources of asymmetry in the rising portion of thermal performance curves: inter-thermy variation across thermoregulatory groups, intra-thermy variation within a thermoregulatory group and rate-dependent variation in how different ecological rates respond to temperature. We use a large empirical dataset on thermal sensitivities across thermoregulatory groups to explore how prevalent thermal asymmetries are in real consumer\textendash resource interactions. We then develop theory to illustrate how food web temperature responses are mediated by the magnitude and direction of these thermal asymmetries. We use this model to show possible conditions under which food webs could respond to warming as currently expected, and when that may not be the case. Our results suggest that inter-thermy, intra-thermy and rate-dependent asymmetries are likely common in natural food webs. We show how all thermal asymmetries have important effects on species abundances across trophic levels as well as the maximum trophic position in the food web. Both the direction of the asymmetries (i.e. which species respond more strongly) and their magnitude (the difference in thermal responses) determine the temperature response of the food web and, consistent with current expectations, top predator abundance almost always declines with temperature, even though maximum trophic position may increase. While our model shows that food web temperature responses can be varied, much of this variation can be explained by considering thermal asymmetries. Our study provides new data and theoretical insights into the widely varying food web effects of warming observed in laboratory, experimental and observational settings, and clarifies how predator and prey thermal ecology may influence overall food web responses in a changing world.

The procedure for estimating saturation density was not repeatable over years and probably abnormally inflated the estimate of sampling error in the experiments. Differences observed between treatments were therefore of dubious biological significance. On the other hand, the estimates of intrinsic growth rates were reliable and repeatable. Contrary to expectation, all the species grew slower in food-enriched medium than in unenriched medium, and no effect of oxygen limitation could be demonstrated. It is concluded that population density regulation of Paramecium is principally determined by accumulation of metabolic wastes of bacteria and the ciliates themselves.},

Here we derive a general model, based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics, that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms (fish, amphibians, aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model also describes nearly 75\% of the variation in post-embryonic development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The remaining variation is partially explained by stoichiometry, specifically the whole-body carbon to phosphorus ratio. Development in other animals at other life stages is also described by this model. These results suggest a general definition of biological time that is approximately invariant and common to all organisms.},

At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented. At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS. Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales.},

Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of C. funebralis populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of C. funebralis, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, modelling efforts indicate that this variation within species extends bloom periods, and likely provides sufficient variability in competitive interactions between species under hydrographically variable conditions. The intraspecific variation most likely correspondsto optimal fitness in temporary microhabitats and may help to explain the paradox of the plankton. Here, we examine the implications of intraspecific variation for the ecology and success of diatoms in general and emphasize the potential implications for our understanding of carbon metabolism in these important organisms. Additionally, data from palaeoecological studies have the potential for evaluating genetic variation through past climate changes, going thousands of years back in time. We suggest pathways for future research including the adoption of multiple strains of individual species into studies of diatom carbon metabolism, to refine our understanding of the variation within and between species, and the inclusion of experimental evolution as a tool for understanding potential evolutionary responses of diatom carbon metabolism to climate change.},

We field parameterised models of competitor dynamics with pairs of 18 California annual plant species, and then related species' niche and fitness differences to their phylogenetic distance. Stabilising niche differences were unrelated to phylogenetic distance, while species' average fitness showed phylogenetic structure. This meant that more distant relatives had greater competitive asymmetry, which should favour the coexistence of close relatives. Nonetheless, coexistence proved unrelated to phylogeny, due in part to increasing variance in fitness differences with phylogenetic distance, a previously overlooked property of such relationships. Together, these findings question the expectation that distant relatives should more readily coexist.},

We combined field-parameterized models of competition among 18 annual plant species with tools from network theory to quantify the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships. We then analyzed the predicted outcome of competitive interactions with and without pairwise niche differences. Intransitive competition was found for just 15\textendash 19\% of the 816 possible triplets, and this mechanism was never sufficient to stabilize the coexistence of the triplet when the pair-wise niche differences between competitors were removed.

Our results argue that intransitive competition may be less frequent than recently posed, and that even when it does operate, pairwise niche differences may be key to possible coexistence.},

Several different empirical methods have been proposed for quantifying ND and RFD in order to make predictions about coexistence between pairs of species, yet it remains unclear which method(s) are appropriate for a given empirical study and whether or not those methods yield the same information. Here we compare six different empirical methods and provide a practical guide to help empiricists determine which method(s) are best for their study system. We show that there are important tradeoffs between mechanistic methods, which require detailed understanding of species' resource use and physiology but are more tractable experimentally, and phenomenological methods which do not require this detailed information but can be impractical for some study designs. Finally, we show that the methods do not always yield the same values and therefore we caution against future syntheses that compile these estimates from different empirical studies.},

As such, ecological surveys are beginning to focus on corals that live in high thermal stress environments to understand how future coral populations may adapt to climate change. We investigated the relationship between coral growth, thermal microhabitat, symbionts type, and thermal acclimatization of four species of the Acropora hyacinthus complex in back-reef lagoons in American Samoa. Coral growth was measured from August 2010 to April 2016 using horizontal planar area of coral colonies derived from photographs and in situ maximum width measurements. Despite marked intraspecific variation, we found that planar colony growth rates were significantly different among cryptic species. The highly heat tolerant A. hyacinthus variant ``HE'' increased in area an average of 2.9\% month-1 (0.03 cm average mean radial extension month-1). By contrast, the three less tolerant species averaged 6.1\% (0.07 cm average mean radial extension month-1). Planar growth rates were 40\% higher on average in corals harboring Clade C versus Clade D symbiont types, although marked inter-colony variation in growth rendered this difference nonsignificant. Planar growth rates for all four species dropped to near zero following a 2015 bleaching event, independent of the visually estimated percent area of bleaching. Within 1 yr, growth rates recovered to previous levels, confirming previous studies that found sublethal effects of thermal stress on coral growth. Long-term studies of individual coral colonies provide an important tool to measure impacts of environmental change and allow integration of coral physiology, genetics, symbionts, and microclimate on reef growth patterns. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. Presence-only SDMs such as MaxEnt frequently use natural history collections (NHCs) as occurrence data, given their huge numbers and accessibility. NHCs are often spatially biased which may generate inaccuracies in SDMs. Here, we test how the distribution of NHCs and MaxEnt predictions relates to a spatial abundance model, based on a large plot dataset for Amazonian tree species, using inverse distance weighting (IDW). We also propose a new pipeline to deal with inconsistencies in NHCs and to limit the area of occupancy of the species. We found a significant but weak positive relationship between the distribution of NHCs and IDW for 66\% of the species. The relationship between SDMs and IDW was also significant but weakly positive for 95\% of the species, and sensitivity for both analyses was high. Furthermore, the pipeline removed half of the NHCs records. Presence-only SDM applications should consider this limitation, especially for large biodiversity assessments projects, when they are automatically generated without subsequent checking. Our pipeline provides a conservative estimate of a species' area of occupancy, within an area slightly larger than its extent of occurrence, compatible to e.g. IUCN red list assessments.},

  abstract = {An ongoing new synthesis in evolutionary theory is expanding our view of the sources of heritable variation beyond point mutations of fixed phenotypic effects to include environmentally sensitive changes in gene regulation. This expansion of the paradigm is necessary given ample evidence for a heritable ability to alter gene expression in response to environmental cues. In consequence, single genotypes are often capable of adaptively expressing different phenotypes in different environments, i.e. are adaptively plastic. We present an individual-based heuristic model to compare the adaptive dynamics of populations composed of plastic or non-plastic genotypes under a wide range of scenarios where we modify environmental variation, mutation rate and costs of plasticity. The model shows that adaptive plasticity contributes to the maintenance of genetic variation within populations, reduces bottlenecks when facing rapid environmental changes and confers an overall faster rate of adaptation. In fluctuating environments, plasticity is favoured by selection and maintained in the population. However, if the environment stabilizes and costs of plasticity are high, plasticity is reduced by selection, leading to genetic assimilation, which could result in species diversification. More broadly, our model shows that adaptive plasticity is a common consequence of selection under environmental heterogeneity, and hence a potentially common phenomenon in nature. Thus, taking adaptive plasticity into account substantially extends our view of adaptive evolution. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

However, little is known about the niches of different mixotrophs and how they affect nutrient cycling and trophodynamics in marine ecosystems. Here we built a plankton food web model incorporating mixotrophic functional diversity. A distinc- tion was made between mixotrophs with the innate capacity for photosynthesis (constitutive mixotrophs, CMs) and those which acquire phototrophy from their prey (non-constitutive mixotrophs, NCMs). We present the simulations of ecosystems limited by different light and nutrient regimes. Our simulations show that strict autotrophic and heterotrophic competitors increased in relative importance in the transition from nutrient to light limitation, consistent with observed oceanic biomass ratios. Among CMs, cells {$<$}20 {$\mu$}m dominate in nutrient-poor conditions while larger cells dominate in light-limited environ- ments. The specificity of the prey from which NCMs acquire their phototrophic potential affects their success, with forms able to exploit diverse prey dominating under nutrient limitation. Overall, mixotrophy decreases the regeneration of inor- ganics and boosts the trophic transfer efficiency of carbon. Our results show that mixotrophic functional diversity has the potential to radically change our understanding of the ecosystem functioning in the lower trophic levels of food webs},

Here, we quantify phenotypic divergence and clinal variation for embolism resistance, hydraulic conductivity and branch growth, in four tree species, two angiosperms (Betula pendula, Populus tremula) and two conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris), across their latitudinal distribution in Europe. Growth and hydraulic efficiency varied widely within species and between populations. The variability of embolism resistance was in general weaker than that of growth and hydraulic efficiency, and very low for all species but Populus tremula. In addition, no and weak support for a safety vs. efficiency trade-off was observed for the angiosperm and conifer species, respectively. The limited variability of embolism resistance observed here for all species except Populus tremula, suggests that forest populations will unlikely be able to adapt hydraulically to drier conditions through the evolution of embolism resistance. \textcopyright{} 2018 Gonz\'alez-Mu\~noz et al.

Theory and evidence suggest that the loss or decline of stress-intolerant species can be compensated for by the growth of other species. Compensatory dynamics are a long-term feature of community dynamics across a broad range of models, and they can have strong stabilizing effects at the community level. Coexistence theory indicates that distinct environmental responses are required for compensatory dynamics and deemphasizes competition. Compensatory dynamics have been detected under experimental conditions, but are not dominant in a metanalysis of field surveys. Recent progress has been made in quantitative methods that detect compensatory dynamics at different temporal scales. Appropriate null models are required to sharpen our understanding of compensatory dynamics in nature. An integrated theory of compensation and compensatory dynamics will improve our ability to understand when communities maintain sufficient response diversity to buffer the effects of environmental change and anthropogenic stress.

We contrast a presence-only maximum entropy model for the widely distributed oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) that includes all available presence locations for this species, with two composite maximum entropy models.

However, so far, most studies have focused on calcifiers. We present the first study of the effects of ocean acidification on the Porifera. Sponge species composition and cover along pH gradients at CO2 vents off Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) was measured at sites with normal pH (8.1-8.2), lowered pH (mean 7.8-7.9, min 7.4-7.5) and extremely low pH (6.6). There was a strong correlation between pH and both sponge cover and species composition. Crambe crambe was the only species present in any abundance in the areas with mean pH 6.6, seven species were present at mean pH 7.8-7.9 and four species (Phorbas tenacior, Petrosia ficiformis, Chondrilla nucula and Hemimycale columella) were restricted to sites with normal pH. Sponge percentage cover decreased significantly from normal to acidified sites. No significant effect of increasing CO2 levels and decreasing pH was found on spicule form in Crambe crambe. This study indicates that increasing CO2 concentrations will likely affect sponge community composition as some demosponge species appear to be more vulnerable than others. Further research into the mechanisms by which acidification affects sponges would be useful in predicting likely effects on sessile marine communities. \textcopyright{} 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

This study assesses the effectiveness of the MPA in improving the survival rate of Hector's dolphin at Banks Peninsula.\textbackslash n2. Over 21 years, we undertook photo-identification surveys of Hector's dolphins along standard- ized transects from small outboard-powered boats.

We estimated mean annual survival during the pre-sanctuary and post-sanctuary periods by applying a Bayesian random effects capture-recapture model to the data. Population growth was estimated from population simulations using a stage-structured matrix model.\textbackslash n3. We estimate a 90\% probability that survival has improved between the pre-sanctuary and post- sanctuary periods, with estimates of mean survival probability increasing by 5\AE 4\% (from 0\AE 863 to 0\AE 917).

A key challenge in this sub-discipline is establishing how important the contribution of evolutionary and ecological processes and their interactions are to observed shifts in population and community characteristics. Although a variety of metrics to separate and quantify the effects of evolutionary and ecological contributions to observed trait changes have been used, they often allocate fractions of observed changes to ecology and evolution in different ways. We used a mathematical and numerical comparison of two commonly used frameworks \textendash{} the Price equation and reaction norms \textendash{} to reveal that the Price equation cannot partition genetic from non-genetic trait change within lineages, whereas the reaction norm approach cannot partition among- from within-lineage trait change. We developed a new metric that combines the strengths of both Price-based and reaction norm metrics, extended all metrics to analyse community change and also incorporated extinction and colonisation of species in these metrics. Depending on whether our new metric is applied to populations or communities, it can correctly separate intraspecific, interspecific, evolutionary, non-evolutionary and interacting eco-evolutionary contributions to trait change.},

  abstract = {Ponto-Caspian gobies are among the most successful fish invaders in inland waters of Europe and in the Great Lakes of North America. Their invasions appear to comprise a combination of passive and active dispersal mechanisms, both natural and human-mediated. Despite the significance of Ponto-Caspian gobies as invasive species, there is little information about the mechanisms underpinning their dispersal. They are relatively small benthic fish, with high site affinity. Thus, actively dispersing individuals must express a behavioural motivation to engage in persistent directional movement. Several recent studies have suggested that inter-individual behavioural differences in boldness, activity level and tendency to explore might underpin dispersal. In addition, because males are highly territorial, intraspecific competition may lead to density-dependent dispersal of subordinate individuals. To date, studies on this subject have focused mainly on comparisons between individuals from the core of established populations with those at the margins and, thus, address the outcome of dispersal rather than the mechanism itself. We conducted a series of experiments on the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus to address the question of what behavioural and physiological traits predict the tendency of an individual to perform dispersal behaviour, specifically considering the role of conspecifics in influencing the tendency to disperse. We used an artificial channel to measure dispersal tendency in this species in combination with behavioural trials. Our results showed that fish with a greater tendency to disperse in an experimental channel grew more slowly and were bolder; that is displayed a greater propensity to emerge from a cryptic background onto a white background and performed worse in prey capture trials. As predicted, intraspecific competition played a primary role in the dispersal of the racer goby. Dominant males showed a tendency to monopolise limited shelters with an outcome that subordinates were forced to disperse upstream. The specific growth rate of individuals appeared to be a good indicator of social position. Subordinate males expressed the lowest rates of growth, probably as a result of long-term deprivation of food in the presence of dominant conspecifics. They were also quicker to explore novel environments, possibly to search for food. Contrary to expectations, subordinate individuals performed relatively poorly in feeding trials when tested individually. Our findings suggest that intraspecific competition in racer goby males is an important mechanism for active dispersal. It can also influence inter-individual variation in traits such as boldness and tendency to explore novel environments. Similar responses to competitive interactions may have encouraged the invasive expansion of other Ponto-Caspian gobies following establishment in new environments, as well as other fish species that exhibit territorial behaviour.},

  abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

  abstract = {Although studies quantifying evolutionary change in response to the selective pressures that organisms face in the wild have demonstrated that organisms can evolve rapidly, we lack a systematic assessment of the frequency, magnitude and direction of rapid evolutionary change across taxa. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 studies that document the effects of warming, predation or competition on the evolution of body size, development rate or fecundity in natural or experimental animal populations. We tested whether there was a consistent effect of any selective agent on any trait, whether the direction of these effects align with theoretical predictions, and whether the three agents select in opposing directions on any trait. Overall, we found weak effects of all three selective agents on trait evolution: none of our nine traits by selective agent combinations had an overall effect that differed from zero, only 31\% of studies had a significant within-study effect, and attributes of the included studies generally did not account for between-study variation in results. One notable exception was that predation targeting adults consistently resulted in the evolution of smaller prey body size. We discuss potential causes of these generally weak responses and consider how our results inform the ongoing development of eco-evolutionary research.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity of the visual environment can influence sexual selection on colourful male secondary traits such that selective advantage is environment contingent. Using a small fish endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia (Telmatherina sarasinorum) that has five male colour morphs varying in frequency between two visually distinct mating habitats, we used direct behavioural observations to test the environment-contingent selection hypothesis. These observations were combined with measurements of the visual environment, fish coloration and the sensitivity of visual photopigments to determine whether differential morph conspicuousness was associated with reproductive success across habitats. We found that blue and yellow males are most conspicuous in different habitats, where they also have the highest reproductive fitness. A less conspicuous grey morph also gained high reproductive success in both habitats, raising the possibility that alternative behaviours may also contribute to reproductive success. In a comprehensive analysis, conspicuousness was strongly correlated with reproductive success across morphs and environments. Our results suggest an important role for spatially heterogeneous environments in the maintenance of male colour polymorphism. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria owe their ubiquity in part to the wide pigment diversity of their light-harvesting complexes. In open ocean waters, cells predominantly possess sophisticated antennae with rods composed of phycocyanin and two types of phycoerythrins (PEI and PEII). Some strains are specialized for harvesting either green or blue light, while others can dynamically modify their light absorption spectrum to match the dominant ambient color. This process, called type IV chromatic acclimation (CA4), has been linked to the presence of a small genomic island occurring in two configurations (CA4-A and CA4-B). While the CA4-A process has been partially characterized, the CA4-B process has remained an enigma. Here we characterize the function of two members of the phycobilin lyase E/F clan, MpeW and MpeQ, in Synechococcus sp. strain A15-62 and demonstrate their critical role in CA4-B. While MpeW, encoded in the CA4-B island and up-regulated in green light, attaches the green light-absorbing chromophore phycoerythrobilin to cysteine-83 of the PEII {$\alpha$}-subunit in green light, MpeQ binds phycoerythrobilin and isomerizes it into the blue light-absorbing phycourobilin at the same site in blue light, reversing the relationship of MpeZ and MpeY in the CA4-A strain RS9916. Our data thus reveal key molecular differences between the two types of chromatic acclimaters, both highly abundant but occupying distinct complementary ecological niches in the ocean. They also support an evolutionary scenario whereby CA4-B island acquisition allowed former blue light specialists to become chromatic acclimaters, while former green light specialists would have acquired this capacity by gaining a CA4-A island.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus cyanobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant in the marine environment and contribute to an estimated 16\% of the ocean net primary productivity. Their light-harvesting complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), are composed of a conserved allophycocyanin core, from which radiates six to eight rods with variable phycobiliprotein and chromophore content. This variability allows Synechococcus cells to optimally exploit the wide variety of spectral niches existing in marine ecosystems. Seven distinct pigment types or subtypes have been identified so far in this taxon based on the phycobiliprotein composition and/or the proportion of the different chromophores in PBS rods. Most genes involved in their biosynthesis and regulation are located in a dedicated genomic region called the PBS rod region. Here, we examine the variability of gene content and organization of this genomic region in a large set of sequenced isolates and natural populations of Synechococcus representative of all known pigment types. All regions start with a tRNA-PheGAA and some possess mobile elements for DNA integration and site-specific recombination, suggesting that their genomic variability relies in part on a ``tycheposon''-like mechanism. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained for PBS and core genes revealed that the evolutionary history of PBS rod genes differs from the core genome and is characterized by the co-existence of different alleles and frequent allelic exchange. We propose a scenario for the evolution of the different pigment types and highlight the importance of incomplete lineage sorting in maintaining a wide diversity of pigment types in different Synechococcus lineages despite multiple speciation events.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades the exploration of deep-water environments using new technologies has revealed insights into parts of our planet that challenge conventional wisdom. Coral reefs, once thought to be restricted to warm shallow waters in tropical and subtropical regions, have been found found in dark, cold, nutrient-rich waters off the coasts of 41 countries so far. They occur in fjords, along the edge of the continental shelf and around offshore submarine banks and seamounts in almost all the worlds oceans and seas. To date, most studies have been carried out in high latitudes, where cold-water reefs occur at depths of hundreds of metres to just 40 metres. However, cold-water corals are increasingly being observed in the tropics, where they thrive at greater depths. Reef-building and habitat-forming corals in cold waters are derived from several systematic groups. The most important of these are the colonial stony corals (Scleractinia), true soft corals (Octocorallia), black corals (Antipatharia) and calcifying lace corals (Hydrozoa). Several species of these groups create reefs and threedimensional, forest-like structures on the sea floor, comparable to their warm-water cousins in size and complexity. These cold-water reefs and structures act like islands in the normally flat, featureless and muddy surroundings and harbour a distinct and rich ecosystem, providing niches and nursery grounds for a variety of species, including commercial fish species. Cold-water coral ecosystems are long lived, slow growing and fragile, which makes them especially vulnerable to physical damage. Regardless of the depth at which these reefs occur, the impact of human activities is evident in almost every survey undertaken. Bottom fisheries, especially using trawls and heavy gear, have already destroyed or scarred several reefs, and represent one of the major threats to cold-water corals. Other documented and potential sources of impact are hydrocarbon and mineral exploration and production, cable and pipeline placement, repair and dumping. We are still only beginning to understand the principal ecological aspects of cold-water corals, including the environmental factors (temperature, salinity, nutrition) and biological processes (reproductive biology, molecular genetics, predation, parasitism and bioerosion) which regulate their life and distribution. It is vident that there are large gaps in our knowledge of cold-water coral reefs which need to be closed by further mapping and integrated, multidisciplinary research including modelling of distribution, geology, biology, ecology and the assessment of human impact. However, already the scientific results and findings clearly demonstrate that cold-water coral ecosystems are important biodiversity hotspots and a biological resource with intrinsic and socio-economic value. In the light of the documented and potential threats, there is an urgent need to prevent further degradation of these vulnerable reefs. Information campaigns and strategic programmes, largely driven by academia and non-governmental organizations have in recent years increased the awareness and recognition of the international community and stakeholders of the importance of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity within and particularly beyond national boundaries. At the time of preparing this report, the need to conserve, protect and manage cold-water coral reefs sustainably is being recognized by governments and major international fora/conventions. Cold-water coral reefs and other high-seas habitats are starting to appear on political agendas and to influence political decision making. Various countries and regional bodies have adopted, or are in the process of establishing, regulations and measures for the protection and management of vulnerable deep-water habitats, including cold-water coral reefs. These range from the use of fisheries regulations to requirements for environmental impact assessments and the development of specific management plans and regulations, including protected areas. In support of these emerging actions, the report concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at providing national and international policy makers and stakeholders from developed and developing countries with a 'toolbox' of options to be considered in the conservation, protection and sustainable management of cold-water corals within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. A total of 24 recommendations have been made (page 63) covering information management and research; improving monitoring and assessment; regulations and measures, including precautionary, preventative and interim measures; and international coordination and awareness.},

The purpose of these seed mixtures has thus far been solely to maintain susceptible pest insects, which will help prevent the development of resistance and preserve utility of the technology. It appears that this narrow focus on resistance management overlooks broader production benefits that may be achieved by planting genotypically diverse cultivar mixtures. While not yet widely employed in modern agriculture, cultivar mixtures have been successfully used for disease management, demonstrating that the strategy is logistically feasible for intensified agriculture. Evidence from both natural and agricultural systems demonstrates that more genotypically diverse plantings can increase yield or productivity through a variety of mechanisms. These effects are in part attributable to improved response to both abiotic and biotic stressors, such as drought, temperature stress, competitors, herbivores, and disease. Similar to transgenic traits, cultivar mixtures also hold promise for resistance management for traditionally bred, or native, traits.},

  abstract = {A hybrid numerical approach was developed to study the dispersion of passive/reactive tracers in the Gulf of Naples (GON). To this end, an Eulerian and a Lagrangian scheme were implemented in the barotropic form of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) and applied to the dispersion of zoo- and phytoplankton in the GON. The hybrid technique was first validated by comparing the tracer concentration patterns from the Eulerian model and maps of particle positions from the Lagrangian model. Excellent agreement in both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of these quantities was found between the two models. Second, the circulation in the GON was simulated using the POM model. While using simplified forcing fields, the simulated circulation patterns in the GON reproduce many observed features. These include the flushing of the GON waters typically occurring in spring and the formation of a close cyclonic gyre (trapping and homogenizing tracers in the GON) in autumn. The circulation patterns are strongly influenced by both the surface wind stresses and bathymetry and only "remotely" by the Tyrrhenian circulation. For the biological application, the spatial and temporal evolution of passive tracers (e.g., nutrients) was simulated using the Eulerian approach and that of the zoo- and phytoplankton using the Lagrangian approach. These populations were assumed to follow a prey-predator relationship and were studied using a grid resolution of 1.5 km. At these scales, the biological and physical processes (e.g., grazing, phyto- and zooplankton growth rate, mesoscale eddies, horizontal turbulent diffusion), influence plankton heterogeneity and patchiness. In particular, the model results show that phytoplankton variability have spatial and temporal scales similar than those of the carrying capacity (considered here as the effect of a limiting nutrient), yet bigger than the flow turbulence due to diffusion processes. The zooplankton population on the other hand develops on smaller scales due to its longer time taken to mature. The temporal evolution of the two populations shows that they follow a cyclical pattern which is smooth at time when the magnitude of the mean flow is much larger than the amplitude of the turbulent component of the ocean current and "noisy" at time when the turbulent component is larger than the mean flow. The high frequency oscillations are caused by the turbulence of the background ocean current through which the parcels move. A time lag of 20 days between phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations was simulated, with the zooplankton temporal variability smaller than that of the phytoplankton. These results show that the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian technique here implemented is an appropriate tool to investigate the complex interactions between physical and biological dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Intraspecific trait change, including altered behaviour or morphology, can drive temporal variation in interspecific interactions and population dynamics. In turn, variation in species' interactions and densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The resulting feedback between species' traits and abundance permits a wide range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to influence trait variation is currently required. We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial predator\textendash prey\textendash resource system. Using this data, we parameterised a trait-dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances. Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change, demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait\textendash abundance feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of ecological dynamics from r2 of 34\% to 57\% and confirmed theoretical expectations of density-dependent population growth and species interactions in the system. Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption. Modelling trait\textendash abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait\textendash abundance feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability of ecological dynamics.

Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very rich communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher- order interactions12,13, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. The existence of higher-order interactions has been debated in ecology for decades14\textendash 16, but their role in shaping ecological communities is still understudied5. Our results show that higher-order interactions can have dramatic effects on the dynamics of ecological systems, pro- ducing models in which coexistence is robust to the perturbation of both population abundances and parameter values. Introducing higher-order interactions has strong effects on models of closed ecological communities, as well as simulations of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. Notably, in our framework higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise inter- actions, easing empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity's stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

  abstract = {Critical transition can occur in many real-world systems. The ability to forecast the occurrence of transition is of major interest in a range of contexts. Various early warning signals (EWSs) have been developed to anticipate the coming critical transition or distinguish types of transition. However, no effective method allows to establish practical threshold indicating the condition when the critical transition is most likely to occur. Here, we introduce a powerful EWS, named dynamical eigenvalue (DEV), that is rooted in bifurcation theory of dynamical systems to estimate the dominant eigenvalue of the system. Theoretically, the absolute value of DEV approaches 1 when the system approaches bifurcation, while its position in the complex plane indicates the type of transition. We demonstrate the efficacy of the DEV approach in model systems with known bifurcation types and also test the DEV approach on various critical transitions in real-world systems.},

However, few studies focus on the potential effects of warming on bacterioplankton in subtropical coastal waters in different seasons. Here we investigated the influences of warming on growth, grazing and community composition of bacterioplankton in Hong Kong coastal waters during winter and summer via 1-day incubation experiments. Our results revealed that without grazers, bacterioplankton displayed higher growth rate during summer compared to winter, while warming only significantly increased the growth rate of bacterioplankton in winter. Grazers with size {$<$}5 {$\mu$}m were major predators of bacterioplankton. Warming had little effect on grazing in summer but significantly enhanced grazing rates of {$>$}5 {$\mu$}m grazers in winter. In both seasons, warming had little influence on bacterial diversity and community composition. Nevertheless, in family and OTU levels, bacterioplankton had different responses to grazing and warming which may result from the selective grazing preference of predators and different temperature optima for bacterioplankton. Furthermore, the presence of {$>$}5 {$\mu$}m and {$<$}5 {$\mu$}m grazers would result in significant increase of some bacterial families under warming condition. Together, our results suggest that warming have direct impacts on bacterioplankton in subtropical coastal waters during winter and may thus affect global biogeochemical cycles.},

Here I examined the potential of no-take marine reserves to reestablish lost predatory interactions and, in turn, cause community-wide changes in Mediterranean rocky reefs. Protected locations supported higher density and size of the most effective fish preying on sea urchins (the sea breams Diplodus sargus and D. vulgaris) than unprotected locations. Density of sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) was lower at protected than at unprotected locations. Size structure of P. lividus was bimodal (a symptom of predation on medium-sized urchins) only at the protected locations. Coralline barrens were less extended at protected than at unprotected locations, whereas turf-forming and erect-branched algae showed an opposite pattern. Erect-unbranched and erect-calcified algae and conspicuous zoobenthic organisms did not show any pattern related to protection. Tethering experiments showed that predation impact on urchins was (1) higher at protected than at unprotected locations, (2) higher on P. lividus than on A. lixula, and (3) higher on medium-sized (2-3.5 cm test diameter) than large-sized ({$>$}3.5 cm) urchins. Sea urchins preyed on by fish in natural conditions were smaller at unprotected than at protected locations. The analysis of sea urchin remains found in Diplodus fish stomachs revealed that medium-sized P. lividus were the most frequently preyed upon urchins and that size range of consumed sea urchins expanded with increasing size of Diplodus fish. These results suggest that (1) depletion and size reduction of predatory fish caused by fishing alter patterns of predation on sea urchins, and that (2) fishing bans (e.g., within no-take marine reserves) may reestablish lost interactions among strongly interactive species in temperate rocky reefs with potential community-wide effects.},

While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.},

Understanding these physicochemical dynamics is critical because how organisms respond to multiple stressors de- pends on the magnitude and relative timing of each stressor. Here, we first discuss broad patterns of covariation between stressors in marine systems at various temporal scales.Wethen describe how these dynamics will influence physiological responses to multi-stressor exposures. Finally, we summarize how multi-stressor effects are currently assessed.Wefind that multi-stressor experiments have rarely incorporated naturalistic physicochemical variation into their designs, and emphasize the importance of doing so to make eco- logically relevant inferences about physiological responses to global change.},

Angiosperm C-values range 1200-fold and frequently vary within species, although little is known about the impacts of domestication on genome size. Genome size variation among related species of palms is of evolutionary significance because changes characterize clades and may be associated with polyploidy, transposon amplifications, deletions, or rearrangements. Further knowledge of genome size will provide crucial information needed for planning of whole genome sequencing and accurate annotations. We studied the genome size of Cocos nucifera and its variation among cultivars, and compared it to values for related palms from the Attaleinae subtribe. M ETHODS: Flow cytometric analysis of isolated nuclei from young palm leaves was used to estimate genome sizes of 23 coconut cultivars (Talls, Dwarfs, and hybrids) worldwide and 17 Cocoseae species. Ancestral genome size was reconstructed on a maximum likelihood phylogeny of Attaleinae from seven WRKY loci. KEY RESULTS: The coconut genome is large\textemdash averaging 5.966 pg\textemdash and shows intraspecific variation associated with domestication. Variation among Tall coconuts was significantly greater than among Dwarfs. Attaleinae genomes showed moderate size variation across genera, except polyploids Jubaeopsis caffra, Voanioala gerardii, Beccariophoenix alfredii, and Allagoptera caudescens, which had larger genomes. C ONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between domestication and genome size in long-lived tree crops and provide a basis for whole-genome sequencing of the coconut and other domesticated plants. Polyploidy evolved independently in two clades within Attaleinae. \textcopyright{} 2015 Botanical Society of America.},

Experiments were conducted on 3 August 2011 (Expt 1), 14 November 2012 (Expt 2) and 1 February 2013 (Expt 3) at a subtropical coastal site adjacent to the South China Sea. Significant enhancement in both phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing were obtained after aerosol addition, but the degree of impact was different in each size fraction. Aerosol input induced significant phytoplankton biomass accumulation as well as community structure shift, with 2.0-, 2.7- and 2.5-fold biomass increases of micro-sized cells and 1.3-, 1.5- and 1.9-fold biomass increases of pico- and nano-sized cells in the 3 experiments, respectively. A large increase in growth rate was obtained for micro-phytoplankton in 2 of the 3 experiments, while pico- and nano-sized cells suffered increased grazing pressure in the aerosol treatment. The different responses resulted in a reduced proportion of protist consumption to phytoplankton daily production (i.e. m/ ratio) and increased net growth rate (- m) in micro-phytoplankton but the opposite in nano- and pico-phytoplankon, which explains the clear shift of phytoplankton size structure in response to aerosol addition. The picoplankton populations did not exhibit apparent biomass accumulation due to efficient cropping by heterotrophic nanoflagellates. Our study is the first direct assessment of the impact of aerosol amendment on microzooplankton grazing activity, and our results suggest that it is important to consider the role of protist grazing when evaluating the effects of atmospheric deposition on marine planktonic ecosystems under the scenarios of increasing human activity, atmospheric input and natural perturbations.},

Twelve populations of P. major and five populations of P. depressa Willd., distributed over regions with average annual temperatures ranging from -2.0 to 18.4, were sampled, the variation of the composition of their cuticular waxes was analyzed, and their values of average chain length (ACL) and carbon preference index (CPI) were calculated. Great intra- and interspecies variations were observed for the total wax contents.

Hence, the pattern of the n-alkane distribution might be a good taxonomic marker for P. major at the intraspecies level, but not at the interspecies level.

Yet, how competitive interactions are influenced by polyploidy that has a wide-spread incidence in plants remains largely unknown. 2. To evaluate the hypothesis of competitive asymmetry between polyploids and diploids, we competed tetraploid and diploid plants of perennial herbaceous Chrysanthemum indicum L. (Asteraceae) at different relative frequencies under contrasting soil water contents. We quantified the interaction intensity between competing plants of the same (intraploidy) and different ploidy levels (interploidy), and measured functional traits related to gas exchange and plant water use to understand the underlying mechanisms. 3. The stronger competitive effect of tetraploids on diploids than that of diploids on tetraploids provided evidence for the competitive asymmetry. As a stronger competitor, tetraploids were limited more by individuals of their own than by diploids. Such competitive asymmetry was not only maintained under reduced soil water content, but also translated into higher above- ground biomass of tetraploids. Tetraploids showed more resource-acquisitive traits than diploids under high soil water content and more resource-conservative traits under reduced soil water content. As such, the higher trait plasticity in tetraploids than diploids likely explained the competitive asymmetry. 4. Synthesis. These results elucidate the nature and magnitude of species interactions between polyploid and diploid plants under changing environments and the underlying mechanisms, and provide important insights into the prevalence and persistence of polyploid plants under a changing climate.},

The idea that predators evolve to be prudent has been dismissed in the 1970s, but the arguments invoked then are untenable in the light of modern evolution theory. The evolution of prudent predation has repeatedly been demonstrated in two-species predator\textendash prey metacommunity models. However, the vigorous population fluctuations that these models predict are not widely observed. Here we show that in complex model food webs prudent predation evolves as a result of consumer-mediated (`apparent') competitive exclusion of resources, which disadvantages aggressive consumers and does not generate such fluctuations. We make testable predictions for empirical signatures of this mechanism and its outcomes. Then we discuss how these predictions are borne out across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Demonstrating explanatory power of evolved prudent predation well beyond the question of predator\textendash prey coexistence, the predicted signatures explain unexpected declines of invasive alien species, the shape of stock\textendash recruitment relations of fish, and the clearance rates of pelagic consumers across the latitudinal gradient and 15 orders of magnitude in body mass. Specific research to further test this theory is proposed.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton are the main primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Their biomass production and CO2 sequestration equals that of all terrestrial plants taken together. Phytoplankton productivity is controlled by a number of environmental factors, many of which currently undergo substantial changes due to anthropogenic global climate change. Most of these factors interact either additively or synergistically. Light availability is an absolute requirement for photosynthesis, but excessive visible and UV radiation impair productivity. Increasing temperatures enhance stratification and decrease the depth of the upper mixing layer exposing the cells to higher solar radiation and reduce nutrient upward transport from upwelling deeper water. At the same time, stratospheric ozone depletion exposes phytoplankton to higher solar UV-B radiation especially in polar and mid-latitudes. Terrestrial runoff carrying sediments and dissolved organic matter into coastal waters leads to eutrophication while reducing UV penetration. All these environmental forcings are known to affect physiological and ecological processes. Ocean acidification due to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations changes the seawater chemistry; it reduces calcification in phytoplankton, macroalgae and many zoological taxa. Ocean warming results in changing species composition and favors blooms of toxic prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Increasing pollution from crude oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metal as well as industrial and household wastewaters affect phytoplankton which is augmented by solar UV radiation. Extensive analyses of the impacts of multiple stressors are scarce. Here, we review reported findings on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on phytoplankton with an emphasis on their interactive effects and make an effort to provide a prospect for future studies.},

  abstract = {Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation, fisheries, and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool, few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively (e.g., attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here, I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density, biomass, size of organisms, and diversity), paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that, on average, with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size, values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carniv- orous fishes, herbivorous fishes, planktivorous fishes/invertebrate eaters, and invertebrates). Surprisingly, results also show that the relative impacts of reserves, such as the proportional differences in density or biomass, are independent of reserve size, suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However, equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves, and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves. The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future, whenever possible, studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve, replicate sampling, and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data, the results from this review suggest that nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve, however, will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve, and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design, management, and evaluation.},

The local environment can play a major role in the magnitude and evolutionary consequences of such a tradeoff. Here, we examined the investment in reproductive and vegetative tissue in 40 maternal half-sib families from four different populations of the herb Plantago coronopus growing in either a dry or wet greenhouse environment. Plants originated from populations with an annual or a perennial life form, with annuals prevailing in drier habitats with greater seasonal variation in both temperature and precipitation. We found that water availability affected the expression of the tradeoff (both phenotypic and genetic) between reproduction and growth, being most accentuated under dry condition. However, populations responded very differently to water treatments. Plants from annual populations showed a similar response to drought condition with little variation among maternal families, suggesting a history of selection favouring genotypes with high allocation to reproduction when water availability is low. Plants from annual populations also expressed the highest level of plasticity. For the perennial populations, one showed a large variation among maternal families in resource allocation and expressed significant negative genetic correlations between reproductive and vegetative biomass under drought. The other perennial population showed less variation in response to treatment and had trait values similar to those of the annuals, although it was significantly less plastic. We stress the importance of considering intraspecific variation in response to environmental change such as drought, as conspecific plants exhibited very different abilities and strategies to respond to high versus low water availability even among geographically close populations. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors. \textcopyright{} 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

However, it is not only humans, but also organisms living in freshwater and marine ecosystems that may be affected by algal toxins. 2. In order to assess if cyanobacterial toxins affect the composition of natural zooplankton communities, we quantified the temporal fluctuations in microcystin concentration and zooplankton community composition in six lakes. 3. Microcystin concentrations generally showed a bimodal pattern with peaks in early summer and in autumn, and total zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with microcystin concentrations. Separating the zooplankton assemblages into finer taxonomic groups revealed that high microcystin concentrations were negatively correlated with Daphnia and calanoid copepods, but positively correlated with small, relatively inefficient phytoplankton feeders, such as cyclopoid copepods, Bosmina and rotifers. 4. In a complementary, mechanistic laboratory experiment using the natural phytoplankton communities from the six lakes, we showed that changes in in situ levels of microcystin were coupled with reduced adult size and diminished juvenile biomass in Daphnia. 5. We argue that in eutrophic lakes, large unselective herbivores, such as Daphnia, are 'sandwiched' between high fish predation and toxic food (cyanobacteria). In combination, these two mechanisms may explain why the zooplankton community in eutrophic lakes generally comprise small forms (e.g. rotifers and Bosmina) and selective raptorial feeders, such as cyclopoid copepods, whereas large, unselective herbivores, such as Daphnia, are rare. Hence, this cyanobacterial chemical warfare against herbivores may add to our knowledge on population and community dynamics among zooplankton in eutrophic systems. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide results in ocean acidification and warming, significantly impacting marine invertebrate larvae development. We investigated how ocean acidification in combination with warming affected D-veliger larvae of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Larvae were reared for 40 h under either control (pH 8.1, 20 ??C), acidified (pH 7.9, 20 ??C), warm (pH 8.1, 22 ??C) or warm acidified (pH 7.9, 22 ??C) conditions. Larvae in acidified conditions were significantly smaller than in the control, but warm acidified conditions mitigated negative effects on size, and increased calcification. A proteomic approach employing two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to quantify proteins and relate their abundance to phenotypic traits. In total 12 differentially abundant spots were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These proteins had roles in metabolism, intra- and extra-cellular matrix formations, stress response, and as molecular chaperones. Seven spots responded to reduced pH, four to increased temperature, and six to acidification and warming. Reduced abundance of proteins such as ATP synthase and GAPDH, and increased abundance of superoxide dismutase, occurred when both pH and temperature changes were imposed, suggesting altered metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress. These results identify key proteins that may be involved in the acclimation of C. gigas larvae to ocean acidification and warming. Significance: Increasing atmospheric CO2 raises sea surface temperatures and results in ocean acidification, two climatic variables known to impact marine organisms. Larvae of calcifying species may be particularly at risk to such changing environmental conditions. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is ecologically and commercially important, and understanding its ability to acclimate to climate change will help to predict how aquaculture of this species is likely to be impacted. Modest, yet realistic changes in pH and/or temperature may be more informative of how populations will respond to contemporary climate change. We showed that concurrent acidification and warming mitigates the negative effects of pH alone on size of larvae, but proteomic analysis reveals altered patterns of metabolism and an increase in oxidative stress suggesting non-additive effects of the interaction between pH and temperature on protein abundance. Thus, even small changes in climate may influence development, with potential consequences later in life.},

Some African colobines, such as guerezas (Colobus guereza), are relatively abundant in disturbed habitats that are very heterogeneous, raising the intriguing possibility that even groups with overlapping home ranges may exhibit large behavioral differences. If such differences occur, it will be important to understand what temporal and spatial scales adequately portray a species' or population's diet and ranging behavior. This study documents within-site variation in the diet and ranging behavior of guerezas in the habitat types in which they are described to be most successful-forest edge and regenerating forest. We collected data on eight groups of guerezas with overlapping home ranges for 3-5 months each in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The guerezas were highly folivorous, with leaves constituting 78.5-94.0\% of the groups' diets. The percentage of mature leaves and fruit in the diet varied widely among and within groups. We show that differences among groups in the intensity with which they fed on specific tree species were not just related to phenology, but also to differences in the forest compositions of groups' core areas. Range size estimates varied more than fivefold among groups and the minimum distance from groups' core areas to eucalyptus forest (which all groups regularly fed in) was a better predictor of range size than was group size. These results reveal considerable variation in the diet and ranging behavior among groups with overlapping ranges and have implications for comparative studies, investigations of within-and between-group feeding competition, and the potential for populations to adapt to anthropogenic or natural environmental change. \textcopyright{} Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2007.},

The distribution of genetic variation across a species' range can reveal critical information that is not necessarily represented in species occurrence or abundance patterns. We identified environmental factors associated with the amount of intraspecific, individual-based genetic variation across the range of a widespread freshwater fish species, the Murray cod Maccullochella peelii. We used two different approaches to statistically quantify the relative importance of predictor variables, allowing for nonlinear relationships: A random forest model and a Bayesian approach. The latter also accounted for population history. Both approaches identified associations between homozygosity by locus and both disturbance to the natural flow regime and mean annual flow. Homozygosity by locus was negatively associated with disturbance to the natural flow regime, suggesting that river reaches with more disturbed flow regimes may support larger, more genetically diverse populations. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that artificially induced perennial flows in regulated channels may provide greater and more consistent habitat and reduce the frequency of population bottlenecks that can occur frequently under the highly variable and unpredictable natural flow regime of the system. Although extensive river regulation across eastern Australia has not had an overall positive effect on Murray cod numbers over the past century, regulation may not represent the primary threat to Murray cod survival. Instead, pressures other than flow regulation may be more critical to the persistence of Murray cod (for example, reduced frequency of large floods, overfishing and chemical pollution). \textcopyright{} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive dif- ferences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three path- ways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species' mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species- level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.},

  abstract = {Making sense of transient dynamics Ecological systems can switch between alternative dynamic states. For example, the species composition of the community can change or nutrient dynamics can shift, even if there is little or no change in underlying environmental conditions. Such switches can be abrupt or more gradual, and a growing number of studies examine the transient dynamics between one state and another\textemdash particularly in the context of anthropogenic global change. Hastings et al. review current knowledge of transient dynamics, showing that hitherto idiosyncratic and individual patterns can be classified into a coherent framework, with important general lessons and directions for future study. Science , this issue p. eaat6412 , BACKGROUND Much of ecological theory and the understanding of ecological systems has been based on the idea that the observed states and dynamics of ecological systems can be represented by stable asymptotic behavior of models describing these systems. Beginning with early work by Lotka and Volterra through the seminal work of May in the 1970s, this view has dominated much of ecological thinking, although concepts such as the idea of tipping points in ecological systems have played an increasingly important role. In contrast to the implied long time scales of asymptotic behavior in mathematical models, both observations of ecological systems and questions related to the management of ecological systems are typically focused on relatively short time scales. A number of models and observations demonstrate possible transient behavior that may persist over very long time periods, followed by rapid changes in dynamics. In these examples, focusing solely on the long-term behavior of systems would be misleading. A long transient is a persistent dynamical regime\textemdash including near-constant dynamics, cyclic dynamics, or even apparently chaotic dynamics\textemdash that persists for more than a few and as many as tens of generations, but which is not the stable long-term dynamic that would eventually occur. These examples have demonstrated the potential importance of transients but have often appeared to be a set of idiosyncratic cases. What is needed is an organized approach that describes when a transient behavior is likely to appear, predicts what factors enhance long transients, and describes the characteristics of this transient behavior. A theory of long ecological transients is a counterpart to the related question of tipping points, where previous work based on an analysis of simple bifurcations has provided broad insights. ADVANCES Just as ideas based on the saddle-node bifurcation provide a basis for understanding tipping points, a suite of ideas from dynamical systems provides a way to organize a systematic study of transient dynamics in ecological systems. As illustrated in the figure, a relatively small number of ideas from dynamical systems are used to categorize the different ways that transients can arise. Translating these abstract results from dynamical systems into observations about both ecological models and ecological system dynamics, it is possible to understand when transients are likely to occur and the various properties of these transients, with implications for ecosystem management and basic ecological theory. Transients can provide an explanation for observed regime shifts that does not depend on underlying environmental changes. Systems that continually change rapidly between different long-lasting dynamics, such as insect outbreaks, may most usefully be viewed using the framework of long transients. An initial focus on conceptual systems, such as two-species systems, establishes the ubiquity of transients and an understanding of what ecological aspects can lead to transients, including the presence of multiple time scales and particular nonlinear interactions. The influences of stochasticity and more realistic higher-dimensional dynamics are shown to increase the likelihood, and possibly the temporal extent, of transient dynamics. OUTLOOK The development of such a framework for organizing the study of transients in ecological systems opens up a number of avenues for future research and application. The approach we describe also raises important questions for further development in dynamical systems. We have not, for example, emphasized nonautonomous systems, which may be required to understand the implications of a changing environment for transients. Systems with explicit time dependence as well as stochastic nonlinear systems still present great mathematical challenges. Implications for management and basic ecological understanding depend on both the results we describe and future developments. A recognition of the difficulty of prediction caused by long transients, and of the corresponding need to match dynamics to transient behaviors of models, shows that basing either management or interpretation of ecological observations only on long-term dynamics can be seriously flawed. Two ways that long transients arise in ecology, illustrated as a ball rolling downhill. ( A ) Slow transition away from a ghost attractor: a state that is not an equilibrium, but would be under slightly different conditions. ( B ) Lingering near a saddle: a state that is attracting from some directions but repelling from others. Additional factors such as stochasticity, multiple time scales, and high system dimension can extend transients. , The importance of transient dynamics in ecological systems and in the models that describe them has become increasingly recognized. However, previous work has typically treated each instance of these dynamics separately. We review both empirical examples and model systems, and outline a classification of transient dynamics based on ideas and concepts from dynamical systems theory. This classification provides ways to understand the likelihood of transients for particular systems, and to guide investigations to determine the timing of sudden switches in dynamics and other characteristics of transients. Implications for both management and underlying ecological theories emerge.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems are nonlinear dynamical systems whose state components lie in an infinite-dimensional space, typically a function space. Such systems, which are also called distributed parameter systems, are ubiquitous in real-life since they are able to model many physical processes, going from conservative mechanical systems to dissipative phenomena. A lot of questions may arise when dealing with such classes of systems. For instance, the well-posedness in terms of existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as the study of the equilibria, their stability and their control are paramount steps when studying these dynamical systems. On the basis of the existing literature, we pay a particular attention to the existence, the uniqueness and the stability of equilibria and the control of nonlinear distributed parameter systems. In particular, as main contributions, we extend the classical approach that allows to deduce the stability of equilibria for a nonlinear system based on the stability of a corresponding linearized version of it. Using a new concept of differentiability for nonlinear operators which takes another space as the state space into account, we show how to guarantee local exponential stability or instability of the equilibria for the original nonlinear system. This is applied to the determination of the stability of the equilibria of a nonlinear plug-flow tubular reactor model with axial dispersion for which the temperature and the reactant concentration are considered as state variables. From a control point of view, the previous results are extended to the stabilization of equilibria of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems. Thanks to this extension, we are able to identify a class of optimally controlled systems for which the required assumptions hold. As another contribution, we study the field of tracking control, and especially funnel control, which constitutes an appropriate tool for the output of a system to track a class of reference signals. As a main contribution on this topic, we extend the available results that allow to consider linear infinite-dimensional systems as internal dynamics to the nonlinear setting. We prove that a general class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems that satisfy some standard assumptions admits a differential relation between the input and the output that is conducive for funnel control. A large number of theoretical results in this thesis are illustrated by means of examples and numerical simulations, especially in the field of process control. The considered applications are related to chemical reactor models, damped wave equations and damped Sine-Gordon equations.},

  abstract = {Shifts in microbial communities and their functioning in response to environmental change result from contemporary interspecific and intraspecific diversity changes. Interspecific changes are driven by ecological shifts in species composition, while intraspecific changes are here assumed to be dominated by evolutionary shifts in genotype frequency. Quantifying the relative contributions of interspecific and intraspecific diversity shifts to community change thus addresses the essential, yet understudied question as to how important ecological and evolutionary contributions are to total community changes. This debate is to date practically constrained by (a) a lack of studies integrating across organizational levels and (b) a mismatch between data requirements of existing partitioning metrics and the feasibility to collect such data, especially in microscopic organisms like phytoplankton. We experimentally assessed the relative ecological and evolutionary contributions to total phytoplankton community changes using a new design and validated its functionality by comparisons to established partitioning metrics. We used a community of coexisting Emiliania huxleyi and Chaetoceros affinis with initially nine genotypes each. First, we exposed the community to elevated CO2 concentration for 80 days ( 50 generations) to induce interspecific and intraspecific diversity changes and a total abundance change. Second, we independently manipulated the induced interspecific and intraspecific diversity changes in an assay to quantify the corresponding ecological and evolutionary contributions to the total change. Third, we applied existing partitioning metrics to our experimental data and compared the outcomes. Total phytoplankton abundance declined to one-fifth in the high CO2 exposed community compared to ambient conditions. Consistently across all applied partitioning metrics, the abundance decline could predominantly be explained by ecological shifts and to a low extent by evolutionary changes. We discuss potential consequences of the observed community changes on ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we explain that the low evolutionary contributions likely resulted of intraspecific diversity changes that occurred irrespectively of CO2. We discuss how the assay could be upscaled to more realistic settings, including more species and drivers. Overall, the presented calculations of eco-evolutionary contributions to phytoplankton community changes constitute another important step towards understanding future phytoplankton shifts, and eco-evolutionary dynamics in general.

Consequently, knowledge of the ecological mechanisms of dispersal is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of these communities. Dispersal is often considered to occur at a constant per capita rate; however, some experiments demonstrated that dispersal may be a function of local species density. Here we use aquatic experimental microcosms under controlled conditions to explore intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal in two protists, a prey Tetrahymena pyriformis and its predator Dileptus sp. We observed intraspecific density-dependent dispersal for the prey and interspecific density-dependent dispersal for both the prey and the predator. Decreased prey density lead to an increase in predator dispersal, while prey dispersal increased with predator density. Additional experiments suggest that the prey is able to detect its predator through chemical cues and to modify its dispersal behaviour accordingly. Density-dependent dispersal suggests that regional processes depend on local community dynamics. We discuss the potential consequences of density-dependent dispersal on metacommunity dynamics and stability. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.

  abstract = {Synechococcus is a cosmopolitan genus of picocyanobacteria living in the photic zone of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701. Remarkably, the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich strains of BSea formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the cpcBA phylogeny, distantly related to other PE-rich groups. Detailed analysis of the cpcBA operon using neighbour-net analysis indicated that the PE-rich BSea strains are probably endemic for the Baltic Sea. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained by the 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpcBA, and the concatenated 16S rRNA-ITS and cpcBA operon sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different Synechococcus lineages. Our results show that microdiversity is important in Synechococcus populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.},

  abstract = {How soil processes such as carbon cycling will respond to future climate change depends on the responses of complex microbial communities, but most ecosystem models assume that microbial functional responses are resilient and can be predicted from simple parameters such as biomass and temperature. Here, we consider how historical contingencies might alter those responses because function depends on prior conditions or biota. Functional resilience can be driven by physiological, community or adaptive shifts; historical contingencies can result from the influence of historical environments or a combination of priority effects and biotic resistance. By modelling microbial population responses to environmental change, we demonstrate that historical environments can constrain soil function with the degree of constraint depending on the magnitude of change in the context of the prior environment. For example microbial assemblages from more constant environments were more sensitive to change leading to poorer functional acclimatisation compared to microbial assemblages from more fluctuating environments. Such historical contingencies can lead to deviations from expected functional responses to climate change as well as local variability in those responses. Our results form a set of interrelated hypotheses regarding soil microbial responses to climate change that warrant future empirical attention.},

However, changes in these different life-cycle events in birds are often investigated separately and by means of ringing records of mixed populations. In this long-term study on the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, we investigated timing of spring and autumn migration in conjunction with timing of breeding. We made distinction among individuals with regard to age, sex, juvenile origin and migratory phase. The data set comprised 22-yr of ringing records and two temporally separated data sets of egg-laying dates and arrival of the breeding population close to the ringing site. The results reveal an overall advancement consistent in most, but not all, phenological events. During spring migration, early and median passage of males and females became earlier by between 4.4 to 6.3 d and median egg-laying dates became earlier by 5 d. Male arrival advanced more, which may lead to an increase in the degree of protandry in the future. Among breeding individuals, only female arrival advanced in timing. In autumn, adults and locally hatched juvenile females did not advanced median passage, but locally hatched juvenile males appeared 4.2 d earlier. Migrating juvenile males and females advanced passage both in early and median migratory phase by between 8.4 to 10.1 d. The dissimilarities in the response between birds of different age, sex and migratory phase emphasize that environmental change may elicit intra-specific selection pressures. The overall consistency of the phenological change in spring, autumn and egg-laying, coupled with the unchanged number of days between median spring and autumn migration in adults, indicate that the breeding area residence has advanced seasonally but remained temporally constant. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.}

This requires gridding routines capable of subsampling high-resolution source data while preserving as much as possible of the small details, at the same time as interpolating in areas with sparse data without generating gridding artifacts. A frequently used gridding method generalizes bicubic spline interpolation and is known as continuous curvature splines in tension. This method is further enhanced in this article in order to specifically handle heterogeneous bathymetric source data. Our method constructs the final grid through stacking several surfaces of different resolutions, each generated using the splines in tension algorithm. With this approach, the gridding resolution is locally adjusted to the density of the source data set: Areas with high-resolution data are gridded at higher resolution than areas with sparse source data. In comparison with some of the most widely used gridding methods, our approach yields superior DBMs based on heterogeneous bathymetric data sets with regard to preserving small bathymetric details in the high-resolution source data, while minimizing interpolation artifacts in the sparsely data constrained regions. Common problems such as artifacts from ship tracklines are suppressed. Even if our stacked continuous curvature splines in tension gridding algorithm has been specifically designed to construct DBMs from heterogeneous bathymetric source data, it may be used to compile regular grids from other geoscientific measurements.},

In terms of the latter, we describe the aims and approaches of the EU-funded project MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems and water Resources under multiple Stress) and the conceptual and analytical framework that it is adopting to provide this knowledge, understanding and tools needed to address multiple stressors. MARS is operating at three scales: At the water body scale, the mechanistic understanding of stressor interactions and their impact upon water resources, ecological status and ecosystem services will be examined through multi-factorial experiments and the analysis of long time-series. At the river basin scale, modelling and empirical approaches will be adopted to characterise relationships between multiple stressors and ecological responses, functions, services and water resources. The effects of future land use and mitigation scenarios in 16 European river basins will be assessed. At the European scale, large-scale spatial analysis will be carried out to identify the relationships amongst stress intensity, ecological status and service provision, with a special focus on large transboundary rivers, lakes and fish. The project will support managers and policy makers in the practical implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), of related legislation and of the Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources by advising the 3rd River Basin Management Planning cycle, the revision of the WFD and by developing new tools for diagnosing and predicting multiple stressors.},

  abstract = {Climate impacts of elevated temperatures and more severe and frequent weather extremes like heatwaves are globally becoming discernible on nature. While a mechanistic understanding is pivotal for ecosystem management, stressors like pesticides may interact with warming, leading to unpredictable effects on freshwater ecosystems. These multiple stressor studies are scarce and experimental designs often lack environmental realism. To investigate the multiple stressor effects, we conducted a microcosm experiment for 48 days comprising benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, macrophytes, and microbes. The fungicide carbendazim (100 {$\mu$}g/L) was investigated combined with temperature scenarios representing elevated temperatures (+4 \textdegree C) or heatwaves (+0 to +8 \textdegree C), both applied with similar energy input on a daily fluctuating ambient temperature (18 \textdegree C {$\pm$} 1.5 \textdegree C), which served as control. Measurements showed the highest carbendazim dissipation in water under heatwaves followed by elevated and ambient temperatures. Average carbendazim concentrations were about 50\% in water and 16\% in sediment of the nominal concentration. In both heated cosms, zooplankton community dynamics revealed an unexpected shift from Rotifera to Cladocera and Copepoda nauplii, indicating variations in their thermal sensitivity, tolerance and resilience. Notably, warming and heatwaves shaped community responses similarly, suggesting heat intensity rather than distribution patterns determined the community structure. Heatwaves led to significant early and longer-lasting adverse effects that were exacerbated over time with Cladocera and Copepoda being most sensitive likely due to significant carbendazim interactions. Finally, a structural equation model demonstrated significant relationships between zooplankton and macrophytes and significantly negative carbendazim effects on zooplankton, whereas positive on macroinvertebrate abundances. The relationship between macroinvertebrate feeding and abundance was masked by significantly temperature-affected microbial leaf litter decomposition. Despite the thermal tolerance of zooplankton communities, our study highlights an increased pesticide threat under temperature extremes. More intense heatwaves are thus likely to cause significant alterations in community assemblages which will adversely affect ecosystem's processes and functions.},

However, such changes do not occur in isolation, and other en- 5 vironmental factors have the potential to modulate the consequences of altered ocean chemistry. Given that physiological mechanisms used by organisms to confront acidifi- cation can be energetically costly, we explored the potential for food supply to influence the response of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae to ocean acidification. In labora- tory experiments, we reared oyster larvae under a factorial combination of pCO2 and 10 food level. High food availability offset the negative consequences of elevated pCO2 on larval shell growth and total dry weight. Low food availability, in contrast, exacerbated these impacts. In both cases, effects of food and pCO2 interacted additively rather than synergistically, indicating that they operated independently. Despite the potential for abundant resources to counteract the consequences of ocean acidification, impacts 15 were never completely negated, suggesting that even under conditions of enhanced primary production and elevated food availability, impacts of ocean acidification may still accrue in some consumers. 1},

Biological trait analysis (BTA) could also be used within risk-assessment frameworks or in conservation planning if one understands the groups of traits that predict the sensitivity of habitats or communities to specific human activities. Deriving sensitivities from BTA should extend sensitivity predictions to a variety of habitats, especially those in which it would be difficult to conduct experiments (e.g., due to depth or risk to human life) and to scales beyond the norm of most experiments. We used data on epibenthos, collected via video along transects at 27 sites in a relatively pristine region of the seafloor, to determine scales of natural spatial variability of derived sensitivities and the degree to which predictions of sensitivity differed among 3 stressors (extraction of species, sedimentation, and suspended sediments) or were affected by underlying community compositions. We used 3 metrics (weighted abundance, abundance of highly sensitive species, and number of highly sensitive species) to derive sensitivity to these stressors and simulated the ability of these metrics to detect a range of stressor intensities. Regardless of spatial patterns of sensitivities across the sampled area, BTA distinguished differences in sensitivity to different stressors. The BTA also successfully separated differences in community composition from differences in sensitivity to stressors. Conversely, the 3 metrics differed widely in their ability to detect simulated impacts and likely reflect underlying ecological processes, suggesting that use of multiple metrics would be informative for spatial planning and allocating conservation priorities. Our results suggest BTA could be used as a first step in strategic prioritization of protected areas and as an underlying layer for spatial planning.},

Efficacy of MPAs is frequently gauged by measuring the direct ecological responses of fish communities. However measuring the indirect, or knock-on effects from protection can provide additional insight into MPA effectiveness at the community level. Here we applied trait-based and community analyses to investigate MPA effectiveness by evaluating both direct and indirect effects of protection on fish assemblages using baited remote underwater stereo-video data from inside and outside 5 no-take MPAs along the South African coastline. The trait-based analyses indicated the presence of a significant overall direct effect (increased abundance of mature individuals targeted by fisheries) and indirect effects (reduction of the abundance of species not targeted by fisheries) inside MPAs, and highlighted that fish maturity is an essential trait to incorporate when assessing direct effects of protection. However, investigation of the species data of the individual MPAs showed positive reserve effects at the community level (both direct and indirect effects) in only 3 MPAs. For the most part these results conform with current theories on the factors that contribute to MPA effectiveness. Yet, one old, large and isolated no-take MPA showed no direct effects of protection, which is attributed to the lack of adequate offshore reef habitat throughout this MPA. While these results support the value of MPAs as ecosystem management tools, they highlight the need for appropriate site selection when designing MPAs.},

Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta-analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time. Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time. We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness. Synthesis and applications: Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We find that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufficient to reflect the overall stability of the system.},

Whether and how quickly communities recover from such pulses is central to our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem organisation, but also to nature conservation and management. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 508 (semi-)natural field experiments globally distributed across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We found recovery to be significant yet incomplete. At the end of the experiments, disturbed treatments resembled controls again when considering abundance (94\%), biomass (82\%), and univariate diversity measures (88\%). Most disturbed treatments did not further depart from control after the pulse, indicating that few studies showed novel trajectories induced by the pulse. Only multivariate community composition on average showed little recovery: disturbed species composition remained dissimilar to the control throughout most experiments. Still, when experiments revealed a higher compositional stability, they tended to also show higher functional stability. Recovery was more complete when systems had high resistance, whereas resilience and resistance were negatively correlated. The overall results were highly consistent across studies, but significant differences between ecosystems and organism groups appeared. Future research on disturbances should aim to understand these differences, but also fill obvious gaps in the empirical assessments for regions (especially the tropics), ecosystems and organisms. In summary, we provide general evidence that (semi-)natural communities can recover from pulse disturbances, but compositional aspects are more vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pulse disturbance than the emergent functions associated to them.},

We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and investigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong Influences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change. ? 2012 by Annual Reviews.

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, 'random', 'regular', 'proportional-stratified' and 'equal-stratified'-to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's {$\kappa$} agreement coefficient. The results show the 'regular' and 'equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

By applying a population modeling framework, we reveal conditions under which population responses from stressors applied to distinct life stages are either magnified (synergistic) or mitigated. We find that magnification or mitigation critically depends on the shape of density dependence, but not the life stage in which it occurs. Stressors are always magnified when density dependence is linear or concave, and magnified or mitigated when it is convex. Using Bayesian numerical methods, we estimated the shape of density dependence for eight species across diverse taxa, finding support for all three shapes.},

  abstract = {Marine sponges constitute major parts of coral reefs and deep-water communities. They often harbour high amounts of phylogenetically and physiologically diverse microbes, which are so far poorly characterized. Many of these sponges regulate their internal oxygen concentration by modulating their ventilation behaviour providing a suitable habitat for both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. In the present study, both aerobic (nitrification) and anaerobic (denitrification, anammox) microbial processes of the nitrogen cycle were quantified in the sponge Geodia barretti and possible involved microbes were identified by molecular techniques. Nitrification rates of 566 nmol N cm(-3) sponge day(-1) were obtained when monitoring the production of nitrite and nitrate. In support of this finding, ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (crenarchaeotes) were found by amplification of the amoA gene, and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira were detected based on rRNA gene analyses. Incubation experiments with stable isotopes ((15)NO(3)(-) and (15)NH(4)(+)) revealed denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) rates of 92 nmol N cm(-3) sponge day(-1) and 3 nmol N cm(-3) sponge day(-1) respectively. Accordingly, sequences closely related to 'Candidatus Scalindua sorokinii' and 'Candidatus Scalindua brodae' were detected in 16S rRNA gene libraries. The amplification of the nirS gene revealed the presence of denitrifiers, likely belonging to the Betaproteobacteria. This is the first proof of anammox and denitrification in the same animal host, and the first proof of anammox and denitrification in sponges. The close and complex interactions of aerobic, anaerobic, autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial processes are fuelled by metabolic waste products of the sponge host, and enable efficient utilization and recirculation of nutrients within the sponge-microbe system. Since denitrification and anammox remove inorganic nitrogen from the environment, sponges may function as so far unrecognized nitrogen sinks in the ocean. In certain marine environments with high sponge cover, sponge-mediated nitrogen mineralization processes might even be more important than sediment processes.},

Here, we performed a comparative, experimental study to investigate variability of cellular traits in three prokaryotic and three eukaryotic freshwater phytoplankton species along gradients of temperature and nitrogen : phosphorus ratio (N : P) in laboratory microcosms. Temperature and N : P strongly affect phytoplankton growth and are changing due to climate change and eutrophication. Metabolic theory and allometric scaling predict that smaller organisms should be favored at higher temperatures through improved metabolic uptake partly due to greater surface area to volume ratios. In addition, chlorophyll-a (Chl a) concentration should increase due to higher chlorophyll synthesis in response to light limitation at higher cell densities. We found that cell volume both in- and decreased with temperature, whereas intermediate N : P yielded higher growth rates and more extreme conditions bigger cell volumes. Species growth responses to these gradients were distinct and not related to phylogenetic differences. Meaningfully coupled traits like the Chl a-fluorescence and cell volume shifted consistently and can improve our understanding of individual cell responses to abiotic drivers. This study showed that intraspecific trait variability of freshwater phytoplankton harbors potential for short term acclimation to environmental gradients. Finally, the high trait variability in some species has strong implications for their ecology and the accuracy of predictions where responses may differ when based on mean or fixed trait values.},

  abstract = {Pieces of coral rubble (Porites porites), collected from across 3 fringing reefs that lie along a eutrophication gradient, were examined for the presence of` clionid sponges. A similarity analysis of species composition showed that reef zone had less effect on clionid community composition than did other factors affecting the reefs as a whole. Except on the back reef, the Lones, distances, and depths within the reefs had no significant influence on the number of clionid invasions. Keef comparisons demonstrated that clionid abundance increased with increasing eutrophication. Clionids were found in 41\% of the pieces collected from the most eutrophic site vs. 24\% from the least eutrophic. Because clionids are the principal bio- eroders of coral reefs, any increase in their abundance will likely result in greater bioerosion rates. The mean abundance of Type 3 corals (in which fragmentation is the primary mode of propagation) is positively related to the frequency of boring sponge invasion. suggesting that increased bioerosion may be partly responsible for community shifts toward Type 3 corals in polluted waters. Cliona cf. vastiJica, found for the first time in Barbados, flourishes on the most eutrophic reef and may become an important bioeroder under the highly eutrophic conditions that have begun to plague West Indian reefs. Two new species of Clionu (Porif`era: Hadro- merida: Clionidae) are described.},

Experimental research in the field of multiple stressors has typically involved varying the number of stressors, here termed stressor richness, but without controlling for total stressor intensity. Mistaking stressor intensity effects for stressor richness effects can misinform management decisions when there is a trade-\-off between mitigating these two factors. We incorporate multiple stressors into three community models and show that, at a fixed total stressor intensity, increasing stressor richness aggravates joint stressor effects on ecosystem functioning, but reduces effects on species persistence and composition. In addition, stressor richness weakens the positive selection and negative complementarity effects on ecosystem function. We identify the among-\-species variation of stressor effects on traits as a key determinant of the resulting community-\-level stressor effects. Taken together, our results unravel the mechanisms linking multiple environmental changes to biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Regional seas are potentially highly vulnerable to climate change, yet are the most directly societally important regions of the marine environment. The combination of widely varying conditions of mixing, forcing, geography (coastline and bathymetry) and exposure to the open-ocean makes these seas subject to a wide range of physical processes that mediates how large scale climate change impacts on these seas' ecosystems. In this paper we explore the response of five regional sea areas to potential future climate change, acting via atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial vectors. These include the Barents Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Celtic Seas, and are contrasted with a region of the Northeast Atlantic. Our aim is to elucidate the controlling dynamical processes and how these vary between and within these seas. We focus on primary production and consider the potential climatic impacts on: long term changes in elemental budgets, seasonal and mesoscale processes that control phytoplankton's exposure to light and nutrients, and briefly direct temperature response. We draw examples from the MEECE FP7 project and five regional model systems each using a common global Earth System Model as forcing. We consider a common analysis approach, and additional sensitivity experiments.Comparing projections for the end of the 21st century with mean present day conditions, these simulations generally show an increase in seasonal and permanent stratification (where present). However, the first order (low- and mid-latitude) effect in the open ocean projections of increased permanent stratification leading to reduced nutrient levels, and so to reduced primary production, is largely absent, except in the NE Atlantic. Even in the two highly stratified, deep water seas we consider (Black and Baltic Seas) the increase in stratification is not seen as a first order control on primary production. Instead, results show a highly heterogeneous picture of positive and negative change arising from complex combinations of multiple physical drivers, including changes in mixing, circulation and temperature, which act both locally and non-locally through advection.},

A bloom dominated by these species began on June 26, 2006, along Kalaloch Beach, Washington, USA, coincident with a drop in the Si(OH) 4 :NO 3 ratio to below two. Multimodal size distributions were detected for both species, and synchronous auxosporulation occurred within the smallest size class during a 3-week window. Auxospores and initial cells created a new class of large cells, and cells in the intermediate size classes increased in abundance during auxosporulation. Mating cells of both species were attached to colonies of surf-zone diatoms. Paired gametangia, gametes, zygotes, auxospores, and large initial cells were found. Auxosporulation began first for P. pungens (June 30), apparently once a critical, high cell concentration was reached, followed by P. australis (July 5), when the total Pseudo-nitzschia cell concentration reached 929,000 cells {$\cdot$} L -1 . Low frequencies of auxosporulation occurred throughout the bloom but increased 4-fold for P. australis and 3-fold for P. pungens when macronutrients were reduced to low levels on July 11. A 2-year life cycle was estimated for P. australis and 3 years for P. pungens, both with annual auxosporulation.

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several ther factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making. {$\lnot$}\textcopyright{} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Yet, little information is available on the effects of ocean acidification on natural phytoplankton assemblages, which are the main primary producers in high-latitude waters. Here we show that coastal Arctic and subarctic primary production is largely insensitive to ocean acidification over a large range of light and temperature levels in different experimental designs. Out of ten CO2-manipulation treatments, significant ocean acidification effects on primary productivity were observed only once (at temperatures below 2 \textdegree C), and shifts in the species composition occurred only three times (without correlation to specific experimental conditions). These results imply a high capacity to compensate for environmental variability, which can be understood in light of the environmental history, tolerance ranges and intraspecific diversity of the dominant phytoplankton species. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).}

  abstract = {Abstract The collapse of ecosystems, the extinction of species, and the breakdown of economic and financial networks usually hinges on topological properties of the underlying networks, such as the existence of self-sustaining (or autocatalytic) feedback cycles. Such collapses can be understood as a massive change of network topology, usually accompanied by the extinction of a macroscopic fraction of nodes and links. It is often related to the breakdown of the last relevant directed catalytic cycle within a dynamical system. Without detailed structural information it seems impossible to state, whether a network is robust or if it is likely to collapse in the near future. Here we show that it is nevertheless possible to predict collapse for a large class of systems that are governed by a linear (or linearized) dynamics. To compute the corresponding early warning signal, we require only non-structural information about the nodes' states such as species abundances in ecosystems, or company revenues in economic networks. It is shown that the existence of a single directed cycle in the network can be detected by a ``quantization effect'' of node states, that exists as a direct consequence of a corollary of the Perron\textendash Frobenius theorem. The proposed early warning signal for the collapse of networked systems captures their structural instability without relying on structural information. We illustrate the validity of the approach in a transparent model of co-evolutionary ecosystems and show this quantization in systems of species evolution, epidemiology, and population dynamics.},

The effects of environmental changes on community stoichiometric characteristics are driven by intra- and inter-specific variation. However, the relative importance of both pathways has seldom been empirically examined. Methods: We quantified the relative contribution of intra- and inter-specific variation to the changes of community nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations after seven-year factorial N addition and mowing treatments in a semi-arid grassland of northern China. Results: Nitrogen addition significantly increased community N and P concentrations and N:P ratio. Mowing significantly increased community N concentration and N:P. Intra-specific variation contributed more than inter-specific variation to the total variability of all the nutritional and stoichiometric characteristics, with intra-specific variation accounting for 68\%, 70\%, and 75\% of the total variation in community-level N, P, and N:P, respectively. Negative covariations between the contribution of intra- and inter-specific variation occurred for community N and P concentrations. Further, N addition and mowing interacted to affect the impacts of intra- and inter-specific variation on community N concentration and N:P stoichiometry. Conclusions: Our results highlight different ways of trait selection for N addition and mowing treatments. Interactions between those two factors make it more difficult to accurately predict the responses of plant-mediated biogeochemical cycles under co-occurrence of environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Biophysical, economic and social factors all make it unlikely that multiple needs will be met simultaneously without deliberate efforts, yet while there is still much interest in developing win-win outcomes there is little understanding of what is required for them to be achieved. We analysed outcomes in a wide range of case studies where ecosystem services had been used for human well-being. Using systematic mapping of the literature from 2000 to 2013, we identified 1324 potentially relevant reports, 92 of which were selected for the review, creating a database of 231 actual or potential recorded trade-offs and synergies. The analysis of these case studies highlighted significant gaps in the literature, including: a limited geographic distribution of case studies, a focus on provisioning as opposed to nonprovisioning services and a lack of studies exploring the link between ecosystem service trade-offs or synergies and the ultimate impact on human well-being. Trade-offs are recorded almost three times as often as synergies and the analysis indicates that there are three significant indicators that a trade-off will occur: at least one of the stakeholders having a private interest in the natural resources available, the involvement of provisioning ecosystem services and at least one of the stakeholders acting at the local scale. There is not, however, a generalisable context for a win-win, indicating that these trade-off indicators, although highlighting where a trade-off may occur do not indicate that it is inevitable. Taking account of why trade-offs occur (e.g. from failures in management or a lack of accounting for all stakeholders) is more likely to create win-win situations than planning for a win-win from the outset. Consequently, taking a trade-offs as opposed to a win-win approach, by having an awareness of and accounting for factors that predict a trade-off (private interest, provisioning versus other ES, local stakeholder) and the reasons why trade-offs are often the outcome, it may be possible to create the synergies we seek to achieve.},

A 30-yr climate data record (CDR) of sea surface temperature (SST) has been produced with daily gap-free analysis fields for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea region from 1982 to 2012 by combining the Pathfinder AVHRR satellite data record with the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) Reprocessing for Climate (ARC) dataset and with in situ observations. A dynamical bias correction scheme adjusts the Pathfinder observations toward the ARC and in situ observations. Largest Pathfinder-ARC differences are found in the summer months, when the Pathfinder observations are up to 0.4\textdegree C colder than the ARC observations on average. Validation against independent in situ observations shows a very stable performance of the data record, with a mean difference of -0.06\textdegree C compared to moored buoys and a 0.46\textdegree C standard deviation of the differences. The mean annual biases of the SST CDR are small for all years, with a negligible temporal trend when compared against drifting and moored buoys. Analysis of the SST CDR reveals that the monthly anomalies for the North Sea, the Danish straits, and the central Baltic Sea regions show a high degree of correlation for interannual and decadal time scales, whereas the monthly variability differs from one region to another. The linear trends of the 1982-2012 SST anomaly time series range from 0.037\textdegree C yr -1 for the North Sea to 0.041\textdegree C yr -1 for the Baltic Sea.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated the combined effects of seawater pH decrease and temperature increase on the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus, an ecological and economic bivalve species widely distributed along the East China Sea. Mussels were exposed to three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.3) and two temperatures (25 ??C and 30 ??C) for 14 days. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured in gills and digestive glands after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure. All enzymatic activities were significantly impacted by pH, temperature. Enzymatic activities at the high temperature were significantly higher than those at the low temperature, and the mussels exposed to pH 7.3 showed significantly higher activities than those under higher pH condition for all enzymes except ACP. There was no interaction between temperature and pH in two third of the measured activities suggesting similar mode of action for both drivers. Interaction was only consistently significant for GPX. PCA revealed positive relationships between the measured biochemical indicators in both gills and digestive glands. Overall, our results suggest that decreased pH and increased temperature induce a similar anti-oxidative response in the thick shell mussel.},

In this study, we compared the community composition of picocyanobacteria from diverse marine ecosystems ranging from estuary to open oceans, tropical to polar oceans and surface to deep water, based on the sequences of 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). A total of 1339 ITS sequences recovered from 20 samples unveiled diverse and several previously unknown clades of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Six high-light (HL)-adapted Prochlorococcus clades were identified, among which clade HLVI had not been described previously. Prochlorococcus clades HLIII, HLIV and HLV, detected in the Equatorial Pacific samples, could be related to the HNLC clades recently found in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC), iron-depleted tropical oceans. At least four novel Synechococcus clades (out of six clades in total) in subcluster 5.3 were found in subtropical open oceans and the South China Sea. A niche partitioning with depth was observed in the Synechococcus subcluster 5.3. Members of Synechococcus subcluster 5.2 were dominant in the high-latitude waters (northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea), suggesting a possible cold- adaptation of some marine Synechococcus in this subcluster. A distinct shift of the picocyanobacterial community was observed from the Bering Sea to the Chukchi Sea, which reflected the change of water temperature. Our study demonstrates that oceanic systems contain a large pool of diverse picocyanobacteria, and further suggest that new genotypes or ecotypes of picocyanobacteria will continue to emerge, as microbial consortia are explored with advanced sequencing technology. \textcopyright{} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Here, we show that range sizes of terrestrial non-volant mammals at the individual and species level show contrasting relationships with two ecological niche dimensions: diet and habitat breadth. While average individual home range size appears to be mainly shaped by the interplay of diet niche breadth and body mass, species geographical range size is primarily related to habitat niche breadth but not to diet niche breadth. Our findings suggest that individual home range size is shaped by the trade-off between energetic requirements, movement capacity and trophic specialisation, whereas species geographical range size is related to the ability to persist under various environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The projected environmental changes triggered by climate change and their velocity raise doubts, whether forest ecosystems are able to adapt to these changes by means of natural processes like gen flow, selection or migration. The European Beech, an ecologically and economically important tree species in Central Europe will also be affected by this development. Therefore silviculture is confronted with the question whether the pheno-typical adaptive capacity of local Beech trees is sufficient to ensure a sustained yield and the stability of Beech stands, or if man has to take supportive action. This study addressed this question with the help of a reciprocal transfer trial with four Bavarian Beech provenances. The cultivation under warmer and drier conditions virtually pre-empts the expected climate changes. In this way the potential of Central European provenances to adapt to these novel conditions could be tested. Simultaneously three Bulgarian Beech provenances were also included in the trial; on the one hand to act as a reference and to assess their adaptive potential under Central European climate conditions on the other. The selective transfer of forest reproductive material or assisted migration of heat- and drought-adapted provenances from the southern range margins in particular is proposed as a tool for climate adaption. This study shows that significant differences in the performance exist between provenances and that these differences can be partly attributed to an adaptation to climatic conditions at the respective region of origin. The Bulgarian provenances, for instance, yielded better germination results in Bulgaria, then the German ones, what indicates local adaption to the nursery site conditions. Likewise the leaf phenology exhibited signs of local adaptation. Usually the Bulgarian provenances flushed earlier, to make use of the favorable conditions in spring; with exception of the mountain provenance Peshtera with leaf phenology adapted to high mountain climate, i.e. late leaf flush, early leaf coloring/fall. However, in terms of height growth the pattern was more complex. German provenance showed higher growth rates than local Bulgarian provenances in the Berkovitza nursery in Bulgaria, whereas in Laufen (Germany) no clear distinction between regions of origin appeared. The strong selection during germination or a potential trade-off between drought-resistance and high growth under favorable conditions might explain this counterintuitive finding. The good growth of German Provenances in Bulgaria, but also the prolonged growth period through all provenances in Laufen compared to Berkovitza points towards a high phenotypic plasticity of height growth. At least in the propagation phase under relatively optimal conditions the German provenances are able to keep up with the Bulgarian provenances at the warmer nursery site in Bulgaria. Whether these findings can be confirmed when the seedlings are at the experimental site, where water shortages can occur in summer, remains to be proven by a future study.}

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

  abstract = {Light is never distributed homogeneously since it forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified not only in terms of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,'' I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant light supply, the species with the lowest I-out* will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances.},

  abstract = {1. Humans have traded and transported alien species for millennia with two notable step-changes: the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, in recent decades the world has entered a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new opportunities for managing invasive species.2. Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases, the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions, especially for island ecosystems.3. Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land and air links in international trade and human transport have established novel pathways for the spread of alien species. Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species management must move at the speed of commerce.4. Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry, as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots that can inform prevention strategies.5. Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure research informs response.},

Temporal dynamics can play an important role in the structure and function of biological assemblages. Here, we investigate the temporal diversity patterns of bee faunas in Southern California coastal sage scrub ecosystems that have been extensively fragmented by urbanization. Using a two-year dataset of 235 bee species (n = 12,036 specimens), we compared 1-ha plots in scrub fragments and scrub reserves with respect to three components of temporal diversity: overall plot-level diversity pooled over time (temporal gamma diversity), diversity at discrete points in time (temporal alpha diversity), and seasonal turnover in assemblage composition (temporal beta diversity). Compared to reserves, fragments harbored bee assemblages with lower species richness and assemblage evenness both when summed across temporal samples (i.e., lower temporal gamma diversity) and at single points in time (i.e., lower temporal alpha diversity). Bee assemblages in fragments also exhibited reduced seasonal turnover (i.e., lower temporal beta diversity). While fragments and reserves did not differ in overall bee abundance, bee abundance in fragments peaked later in the season compared to that in reserves. Our results argue for an increased awareness of temporal diversity patterns, as information about the distinct components of temporal diversity is essential both for characterizing the assemblage dynamics of seasonal organisms and for identifying potential impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem function through its effects on assemblage dynamics.},

A 2,154 km transect was completed south of Australia. Sea surface temperature (SST) measured at 1 min intervals showed that seven physical zones were sampled. Zooplankton were collected at a spatial resolution of {$\sim$}9.2 km with a continuous plankton recorder, identified to the highest possible taxonomic resolution and enumerated. Zooplankton assemblage similarity between samples was calculated using the Bray\textendash Curtis index for the taxonomic levels of species, genus, family, order and class after first log10(x + 1) (LA) and then presence/absence (PA) transformation of abundance data. Although within and between zone sample similarity increased with decreasing taxonomic resolution, for both data transformations, cluster analysis demonstrated that the biogeographic separation of zones remained at all taxonomic levels when using LA data. ANOSIM confirmed this, detecting significant differences in zooplankton assemblage structure between all seven a priori determined physical zones for all taxonomic levels when using the LA data. In the case of the PA data for the complete data set, and both LA and PA data for a crustacean only data set, no significant differences were detected between zooplankton assemblages in the Polar frontal zone (PFZ) and inter-PFZ at any taxonomic level. Loss of information at resolutions below the species level, particularly in the PA data, prevented the separation of some zones. However, the majority of physical zones were biogeographically distinct from species level to class using both LA and PA transformations. Significant relationships between SST and zooplankton community structure, summarised as NMDS scores, at all taxonomic levels, for both LA and PA transformations, and complete and crustacean only data sets, highlighted the biogeographic relevance of low resolution taxonomic data. The retention of biogeographic information in low taxonomic resolution data shows that data sets collected with different taxonomic resolutions may be meaningfully merged for the post hoc generation of Southern Ocean time series.},

  abstract = {Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment, erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ``hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ``diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ``diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ``diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ``hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ``hidden treatments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

Many criteria have been used to define the notion of long-term survival. We consider here the subject of permanence, i.e., the study of the long-term survival of each species in a set of populations. These situations may often be modeled successfully by dynamical systems and have led to the development of some interesting mathematical techniques and results. Our intention here is to describe these and to consider their application to several of the most frequently used models occurring in mathematical biology.

Northern vole and lemming species are particularly well-known for their spatially synchronized population dynamics. Here, we use results from an experimental study to demonstrate that tundra vole dispersal movements did not act to synchronize population dynamics in fragmented habitats. In contrast to the constant dispersal rate assumed in earlier theoretical studies, the tundra vole, and many other species, exhibit negative density-dependent dispersal. Simulations of a simple mathematical model, parametrized on the basis of our experimental data, verify the empirical results, namely that the observed negative density-dependent dispersal did not have a significant synchronizing effect. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Royal Society.},

Yet, little is known about how farm managers invoke leaf functional traits to inform management decisions. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate whether farmers use knowledge of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in LES traits (or trait proxies) of target crops as response indicators of management conditions; (2) determine whether LES trait values are ranked consistently among multiple farmers along a ``Farmer Leaf Economics Spectrum'' (FES); (3) evaluate how a FES corresponds to the LES; and (4) identify the farmer and farm attributes that best predict the agreement between the FES and the LES. We collaborated with coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers in the Turrialba Valley, Costa Rica. We used a visual elicitation tool of fresh leaves along an intraspecific spectrum of leaf size, leaf thickness and leaf colour (as a proxy for leaf nutrients); respondents were asked to rank leaves in response to shade and nutrient scenarios as well as yield potential. On-farm biophysical data, management practices and socio-economic attributes were also collected. The majority of farmers demonstrated a developed system of utilizing coffee leaf and whole-plant ITV as indicators of management practices. Farmers managing smaller farms tended to more commonly acknowledge ITV in LES chemical\textendash morphological traits, as compared to those managing large farms. The agreement between a respondent-identified ranking of leaf thickness ITV as a function of light environment and an empirically defined thickness-to-light ranking was partially explained by farmers' physical engagement with plants. Synthesis and applications. In scientific literature, analyses of crop intraspecific trait variation have provided important insights into the mechanistic bases of multiple key agroecological processes. We demonstrate that farmers use crop leaf trait variation as an indicator to both evaluate management prescriptions and to initiate management actions including shade-tree species selection and abundance, crop- and shade-tree pruning regimes and fertilization treatments. These findings signify that functional traits represent a key nexus between scientific and local knowledge. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

It remains unknown whether such shifts in biodiversity and species composition may, themselves, be major contributors to the total, long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers on ecosystem functioning. Moreover, although numerous experiments have shown that random losses of species impact the functioning of ecosystems, human-caused losses of biodiversity are rarely random. Here we use results from long-term grassland field experiments to test for direct effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on ecosystem productivity, and for indirect effects of enrichment on productivity mediated by resultant species losses. We found that ecosystem productivity decreased through time most in plots that lost the most species. Chronic nitrogen addition also led to the nonrandom loss of initially dominant native perennial C-4 grasses. This loss of dominant plant species was associated with twice as great a loss of productivity per lost species than occurred with random species loss in a nearby biodiversity experiment. Thus, although chronic nitrogen enrichment initially increased productivity, it also led to loss of plant species, including initially dominant species, which then caused substantial diminishing returns from nitrogen fertilization. In contrast, elevated CO2 did not decrease grassland plant diversity, and it consistently promoted productivity over time. Our results support the hypothesis that the long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers of environmental change on ecosystem functioning can strongly depend on how such drivers gradually decrease biodiversity and restructure communities.},

Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

The cod occurs also in the brackish Baltic Sea, where besides fishing, several abiotic and biotic factors have a strong effect on their population dynamics. All cod stocks have diminished simultaneously due to heavy exploitation. Maintaining a sustainable fishery requires sufficient understanding of the recovery process and adequately tailored management plans. In marine habitats, temporal environmental fluctuations are often positively autocorrelated. Yet the temporal autocorrelation is often disregarded in models estimating fishery stock dynamics. For the Eastern Baltic cod ( Gadus morhua callarias), the main environmental factors are water salinity and oxygen concentrations, which determine species distribution and reproductive success. The Baltic Sea's oceanographic characteristics make the ecosystem sensitive and climate change is expected to convert the type and magnitude of environmental fluctuations. This could potentially lead to inaccurate stock estimation and requires reassessment for any management strategy. We analyzed the recovery potential of the Eastern Baltic cod ( Gadus morhua callarias) under different fishery and environmental scenarios. Our results illustrate how the unpredictability of stock size, catch, and recovery increase with increasing environmental autocorrelation. Under current environmental conditions and threshold methods fishing is at sustainable level. However, under more radical environmental fluctuations, like global warming, the estimation of cod population recovery becomes more difficult. Moreover, the precautionary fishing methods are important for population recovery by ensuring more sustainable fishing and preventing stock collapses. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

FRED represents a critical step toward improving our understanding of below-ground plant ecology. For example, FRED facilitates the quantification of variation in fine-root traits across root orders, species, biomes, and environmental gradients while also providing a platform for assessments of covariation among root, leaf, and wood traits, the role of fine roots in ecosystem functioning, and the representation of fine roots in terrestrial biosphere models. Continued input of observations into FRED to fill gaps in trait coverage will improve our understanding of changes in fine-root traits across space and time.},

Although most studies have assumed that species go extinct randomly, species often go extinct in order of their sensitivity to a stress that intensifies through time (such as climate change). Here we show that the consequences of random and ordered extinctions differ. Both depend on food-web interactions that create compensation; that is, the increase of some species when their competitors and/or predators decrease in density due to environmental stress. Compensation makes communities as a whole more resistant to stress by reducing changes in combined species densities. As extinctions progress, the potential for compensation is depleted, and communities become progressively less resistant. For ordered extinctions, however, this depletion is offset and communities retain their resistance, because the surviving species have greater average resistance to the stress. Despite extinctions being ordered, changes in the food web with successive extinctions make it difficult to predict which species will show compensation in the future. This unpredictability argues for \&apos;whole-ecosystem\&apos; approaches to biodiversity conservation, as seemingly insignificant species may become important after other species go extinct.},

Further, spatial variation in these leaf components drives local ecological matching: in experiments using artificial food sources distinguished only by the chemical content of individual trees, we found decomposers both on land and in rivers more quickly consumed locally derived food sources.

As integrators of local catchment and regional pro- cesses, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional perfor- mance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-count- ing method revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41\%) than synergistic (28\%), additive (16\%) or reversed (15\%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adap- tation to multiple stressors.},

While local conditions are often found to drive dispersal decisions, local context is not always a reliable predictor of conditions in neighbouring patches, making the use of local information potentially useless or even maladaptive. In this case, using social information gathered by immigrants might allow adjusting dispersal decisions without paying the costs of prospecting. However, this hypothesis has been largely neglected despite its major importance for ecological and evolutionary processes. 2. We investigated three fundamental questions about immigrant informed dispersal: do immigrants convey information that influences dispersal, do organisms use multiple cues from immigrants, and is immigrant informed dispersal genotype-dependent? 3. Using Tetrahymena thermophila ciliates in microcosms, we manipulated the number of immigrants arriving, the density of congeners and resource quality in neighbouring patches, matrix characteristics and the level of cooperation of individuals in the neighbouring populations. 4. We provide the first experimental evidence that immigrants convey a number of different cues about neighbouring patches and matrix (patch quality, matrix characteristics, and cooperation in neighbouring populations) in this relatively simple organism. Furthermore, we demonstrate genotype- dependent immigrant-informed dispersal decisions about patch quality and matrix characteristics. 5. Multiple cues from immigrants and genotype-dependent use of cues have major implications for theoretical metapopulation dynamics and the potential for local adaptation.},

Dispersal plays a controversial role in the evolution of cooperation: dispersal decreases local population relatedness and thus opposes the evolution of cooperation, but limited dispersal increases kin competition and can negate the benefits of cooperation. Theoretical work has suggested that plasticity of dispersal, where individuals can adjust their dispersal decisions according to the social context, might help resolve this paradox and promote the evolution of cooperation. Here, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that conditional dispersal decisions are mediated by a cooperative strategy: we quantified the density-dependent dispersal decisions and subsequent colonization efficiency from single cells or groups of cells among six genetic strains of the unicellular Tetrahymena thermophila that differ in their aggregation level (high, medium, and low), a behavior associated with cooperation strategy. We found that the plastic reaction norms of dispersal rate relative to density differed according to aggregation level: highly aggregative genotypes showed negative density-dependent dispersal, whereas low-aggregation genotypes showed maximum dispersal rates at intermediate density, and medium-aggregation genotypes showed density-independent dispersal with intermediate dispersal rate. Dispersers from highly aggregative genotypes had specialized long-distance dispersal phenotypes, contrary to low-aggregation genotypes; medium-aggregation genotypes showing intermediate dispersal phenotype. Moreover, highly aggregation genotypes showed evidence for beneficial kin-cooperation during dispersal. Our experimental results should help to resolve the evolutionary conflict between cooperation and dispersal: cooperative individuals are expected to avoid kin-competition by dispersing long distances, but maintain the benefits of cooperation by dispersing in small groups.},

We demonstrate that in our simple two-patch microcosms, differences among genotypes are at least as important as spatiotemporal variability of resources for metapopulation dynamics. Furthermore, we show that an important proportion of this effect results from variability of dispersal syndromes. These syndromes can therefore be as important for metapopulation dynamics as spatiotemporal variability of environmental conditions. This study demonstrates that intraspecific variability in dispersal syndromes can be key in the functioning of metapopulations facing environmental changes.},

Using a phytoplankton\textemdash grazer model parameterized for Daphnia pulex with either flexible or fixed algal carbon: nutrient stoichiometry, we explored how nutrient and light supply (the latter by varying depth of the mixed water column) affect the transient dynamics of the system starting from low densities. The system goes through an initial oscillation across nearly the entire light\textemdash nutrient supply space. With flexible (but not with fixed) algal stoichiometry, duration of the initial algal peak, timing and duration of the subsequent grazer peak, and timing of the algal minimum are consistently accelerated by nutrient enrichment but decelerated by light enrichment (decreasing mixing depth) over the range of intermediate to shallow mixing depths. These contrasting effects of nutrient vs. light enrichment are consequences of their opposing influences on food quality (algal nutrient content): algal productivity and food quality are positively related along a nutrient gradient but inversely related along a light gradient. Light enrichment therefore slows down grazer growth relative to algal growth, decelerating oscillatory dynamics; nutrient enrichment has opposite effects. We manipulated nutrient supply and mixing depth in a field enclosure experiment. The experimental results were qualitatively much more consistent with the flexible than with the fixed stoichiometry model. Nutrient enrichment increased Daphnia peak biomass, decreased algal minimum biomass, decreased the seston C:P ratio, and accelerated transient oscillatory dynamics. Light enrichment (decreasing mixing depth) produced the opposite patterns, except that Daphnia peak biomass increased monotonously with light enrichment, too. Thus, while the model predicts the possibility of the "paradox of energy enrichment" (a decrease in grazer biomass with light enrichment) at high light and low nutrient supply, this phenomenon did not occur in our experiment.},

  abstract = {Research Highlights: In this study, we found different regulatory mechanisms in two contrasting provenances of Norway spruce responding to progressive drought stress. Background and Objectives: In the context of climate and environmental changes, the following question of high importance in scientific studies is: How will Norway spruce, which forms a dominant component in European mountain and boreal forests, be able to cope with the increasing frequencies and intensities of drought periods? The aim of the study was to investigate the physiological responses of eight-month-old seedlings, as a most vulnerable phase of forest tree life, for different spruce provenances, to find out variable strategies in relation to controlled drought stress. Materials and Methods: We performed an experiment under controlled conditions with spruce seedlings from a climatologically warmer stand of 410 m above sea level (a.s.l.), and a moderately cool stand of 931 m a.s.l. The soil water content, leaf predawn water potential, the osmotic potential of needles, the relative water content of needles, and the photosynthetic performance and the contents of primary metabolites (proline and abscisic acid) were investigated as indicators of the spruce seedlings' responses to water stress. The status of the indicators was analyzed at different temporal intervals, using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), reflecting the seedlings' water conditions (early drought, drought, or recovery). On a daily basis, the differences among the indicators were tested with one-way ANOVA. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the provenance-specific responses of tree drought indicators in a multi-dimensional data set. Results: The responses to drought stress differed between the provenances. Whereas seedlings of 'warm' provenance from a low altitude performed a conservation strategy, with high amounts of accumulated abscisic acid and closing the stomata faster, the reactions of 'cool' provenance seedlings from a higher altitude were not so sensitive and the plants' water supply and photosynthetic performance remained significantly higher. These findings indicate that a higher drought resistance in 'cool' provenance could be related to greater amounts of proline amino-acids, which are accumulated from the beginning of the drought simulation. Furthermore, proline accumulation resulting in increased stress tolerance is controlled through another mechanism than osmotic adjustment. Conclusions: The observed variations in the regulatory mechanisms used to develop adaptive strategies in different provenances are an important factor for seedling survival under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {There are many scales at which to quantify stability in spatial and ecological networks. Local-scale analyses focus on specific nodes of the spatial network, while regionalscale analyses consider the whole network. Similarly, species- and community-level analyses either account for single species or for the whole community. Furthermore, stability itself can be defined in multiple ways, including resistance (the inverse of the relative displacement caused by a perturbation), initial resilience (the rate of return after a perturbation), and invariability (the inverse of the relative amplitude of the population fluctuations). Here, we analyze the scale-dependence of these stability properties. More specifically, we ask how spatial scale (local vs. regional) and ecological scale (species vs. community) influence these stability properties. We find that regional initial resilience is the weighted arithmetic mean of the local initial resiliences. The regional resistance is the harmonic mean of local resistances, which makes regional resistance particularly vulnerable to nodes with low stability, unlike regional initial resilience. Analogous results hold for the relationship between community- and species-level initial resilience and resistance. Both resistance and initial resilience are ``scale-free'' properties: regional and community values are simply the biomass-weighted means of the local and species values, respectively. Thus, one can easily estimate both stability metrics of whole networks from partial sampling. In contrast, invariability generally is greater at the regional and community-level than at the local and species-level, respectively. Hence, estimating the invariability of spatial or ecological networks from measurements at the local or species level is more complicated, requiring an unbiased estimate of the network (i.e., region or community) size. In conclusion, we find that scaling of stability depends on the metric considered, and we present a reliable framework to estimate these metrics.},

Habitat suitability modeling provides a tool for researchers and managers to understand the potential extent of invasive species spread. Our goal was to use habitat suitability modeling to map potential habitat of the riparian plant invader, Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Russian olive has invaded riparian habitat across North America and is continuing to expand its range. We compiled 11 disparate datasets for Russian olive presence locations (n = 1,051 points and 139 polygons) in the western US and used Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to develop two habitat suitability maps for Russian olive in the western United States: one with coarse-scale water data and one with fine-scale water data. Our models were able to accurately predict current suitable Russian olive habitat (Coarse model: training AUC = 0.938, test AUC = 0.907; Fine model: training AUC = 0.923, test AUC = 0.885). Distance to water was the most important predictor for Russian olive presence in our coarse-scale water model, but it was only the fifth most important variable in the fine-scale model, suggesting that when water bodies are considered on a fine scale, Russian olive does not necessarily rely on water. Our model predicted that Russian olive has suitable habitat further west from its current distribution, expanding into the west coast and central North America. Our methodology proves useful for identifying potential future areas of invasion. Model results may be influenced by locations of cultivated individuals and sampling bias. Further study is needed to examine the potential for Russian olive to invade beyond its current range. Habitat suitability modeling provides an essential tool for enhancing our understanding of invasive species spread. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Snapshot samples from 75 WWTP effluents were collected and analysed for concentrations of 150 polar organic and 20 inorganic compounds as well as estrogenicity using the MVLN reporter gene assay. The effect-based assessment determined estrogenicity in 27 of 75 samples tested with the concentrations ranging from 0.53 to 17.9 ng/L of 17-beta-estradiol equivalents (EEQ). Approximately one third of municipal WWTP effluents contained EEQ greater than 0.5 ng/L EEQ, which confirmed the importance of cities as the major contamination source. Beside municipal WWTPs, some treated industrial wastewaters also exhibited detectable EEQ, indicating the importance to investigate phytoestrogens released from plant processing factories. No steroid estrogens were detected in any of the samples by instrumental methods above their limits of quantification of 10 ng/L, and none of the other analysed classes of chemicals showed correlation with detected EEQs. The study demonstrates the need of effect-based monitoring to assess certain classes of contaminants such as estrogens, which are known to occur at low concentrations being of serious toxicological concern for aquatic biota.},

Presence of a hitherto unidentified food source not included in the model could also contribute to the shift. During the 2-month occurrence of C. capillata, its isotope composition remained stable and was consistent with a mainly mesozooplanktonic diet. Mixing model output, mainly driven by {$\delta$}34S values, indicated a lower proportion of A. aurita in the diet of C. capillata than previously reported, and thus to a potentially lesser importance of intraguild predation among jellyfish in the Kiel Fjord.

However, these mechanisms may not be independent as species can exhibit behavioral or physiological changes in response to competition that alters their colonization rates. This study examines the effect of interspecific interactions on the colonization rates of four microscopic species (three ciliates and a rotifer) in aquatic microcosms. Two species showed significant reductions in the time to colonize patches when confronted with a competitor, one was a good disperser (Colpidium striatum) and the other was the slowest disperser (Philodina spp.). These results indicate that species' colonization rates in a metacommunity can vary depending on the presence of competitors.

Stressing modern is important here, as earlier researchers also investigated this topic, for example Darwin (1859; Cadotte, 2006). Kowarik \& Py\v{s}ek (2012) offer insights into the history of invasion ecology with a focus on the Swiss botanist Albert Thellung (1881\textendash 1928) who took the first steps towards unifying concepts and hypotheses in invasion ecology. Fifty years after the publication of Elton's book, a special issue of Diversity and Distributions was dedicated to Elton's legacy. An editorial in this special issue outlined how influential Elton and his work remains today (Richardson \& Py\v{s}ek, 2008). Elton's 1958 book is the most frequently cited source in the field, and several of invasion ecology's current major hypotheses can be found there, for example the biotic resistance hypothesis (Richardson \& Py\v{s}ek, 2007).},

Yet, the variation of divergence across species with different ecologies and distributions and the relative role of adaptive causes remains little understood. We predict that genetic control vs. phenotypic plasticity of traits, geographical distance and (assuming adaptation) environmental differences should explain much of the phenotypic variability between populations. We tested these predictions with body sizes of 1447 populations in 98 terrestrial vertebrate species. Population phenotypic variability differs strongly across species, and divergence increases with increasing levels of clade-typical phenotypic plasticity, the area covered by populations and body size. Geographical distance and environmental dissimilarity are similarly important predictors of divergence within species, highlighting a potential role for biotic and environmental conditions. Increased availability of phylogeographical and ecological data should facilitate further understanding of population divergence drivers at broad scales. \textcopyright{} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

  abstract = {Ecologists often determine the relative importance of niche- and dispersal-based processes via variation partitioning based on species composition. Functional traits and their proxies of phylogeny are expected to increase the detection of niche-based processes and reduce the unexplained variation relative to species identity. We collected eight adult tree traits and phylogenetic data of 41 species and employed a phylogenetic fuzzy weighting method to address this issue in a 9-ha temperate forest dynamics plot. We used redundancy analysis to relate species, phylogenetic and functional compositions to environmental (soil resources and topography) and spatial variables. We also performed multi-scaled analyses on spatial variables by adding environment as the covariates to determine if functional traits increase the detection of niche-based processes at broad scales. The functional traits and intraspecific variation of the wood density among ontogenetic stages could dramatically increase the detection of niche-based processes and reduce the unexplained variation relative to species identity. Phylogenetic and functional compositions were mainly driven by total soil P and elevation, while species composition was weakly affected by multiple environmental variables. After controlling for the environment, a larger amount of the compositional variations in seed mass and maximum height were explained by finer-scaled spatial variables, indicating that dispersal processes may be important at fine spatial scales. Our results suggested that considering functional traits and their intraspecific variations could improve our understanding of ecological processes and increase our ability to predict the responses of plants to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {The rate of microbial respiration can be described by a rate law that gives the respiration rate as the product of a rate constant, biomass concentration, and three terms: one describing the kinetics of the electron-donating reaction, one for the kinetics of the electron-accepting reaction, and a thermodynamic term accounting for the energy available in the microbe's environment. The rate law, derived on the basis of chemiosmotic theory and nonlinear thermodynamics, is unique in that it accounts for both forward and reverse fluxes through the electron transport chain. Our analysis demonstrates how a microbe's respiration rate depends on the thermodynamic driving force, i.e., the net difference between the energy available from the environment and energy conserved as ATP. The rate laws commonly applied in microbiology, such as the Monod equation, are specific simplifications of the general law presented. The new rate law is significant because it affords the possibility of extrapolating in a rigorous manner from laboratory experiment to a broad range of natural conditions, including microbial growth where only limited energy is available. The rate law also provides a new explanation of threshold phenomena, which may reflect a thermodynamic equilibrium where the energy released by electron transfer balances that conserved by ADP phosphorylation.},

We used Aqua\textendash Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) to identify major dust outbreaks, defined as AOD events one standard deviation above the background along the African coast. Dry air outbreaks were defined using water vapor data of the Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounder. Dry air outbreaks do not always coincide with dust outbreaks. Most boreal summer outbreaks reached the West Indies between 10\textdegree N and 20\textdegree N, some traveling on to the southeastern United States; winter outbreaks moved to South America between 0\textdegree{} and 10\textdegree N. Outbreaks travel westward at an average speed of 1000 km d-1, reaching the Caribbean or South America in a week's time. The advance of a dust front is associated with decreases in water vapor (up to -1.0 g kg-1) and increases in temperature (up to 1.0 K) and, behind the fronts, an anticyclonic circulation. We used Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data to characterize dust altitude distributions. The vertical distribution of warm dry air is similar to that of dust observed in CALIPSO. The dust layer altitude decreases during transport across the Atlantic and is significantly lower in boreal winter than summer. The study highlights the temporal and spatial variability of African dust outbreaks, which are important to improving our understanding of climate impacts of African dust and Atlantic climate variability in general.},

Application of these methods has led to corresponding studies evaluating the sensitivity of model performance to requisite data and other factors that may lead to imprecise or false inferences. We expand upon these works by providing a relative measure of the sensitivity of model parameters and prediction to common sources of error, bias, and variability. We used a one-at-a-time sample design and GPS location data for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to assess one common species-distribution model: a resource selection function. Our measures of sensitivity included change in coefficient values, prediction success, and the area of mapped habitats following the systematic introduction of geographic error and bias in occurrence data, thematic misclassification of resource maps, and variation in model design. Results suggested that error, bias and model variation have a large impact on the direct interpretation of coefficients. Prediction success and definition of important habitats were less responsive to the perturbations we introduced to the baseline model. Model coefficients, prediction success, and area of ranked habitats were most sensitive to positional error in species locations followed by sampling bias, misclassification of resources, and variation in model design. We recommend that researchers report, and practitioners consider, levels of error and bias introduced to predictive species-distribution models. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are the most effective means for evaluating and focusing improvements on input data and considering the range of values possible from imperfect models. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We advocate the need for a standardized mechanistic approach for linking individual mechanisms (physiology, behaviour, and evolution) to population dynamics in spatially explicit landscapes. Such an approach is potentially more flexible and informative than current population models. Key to realizing this goal, however, is overcoming current data limitations, the development and testing of eco-evolutionary theory to represent interactions between individual mechanisms, and standardized multi-dimensional environmental change scenarios which incorporate multiple stressors. Such progress is essential in supporting environmental decisions in uncertain future conditions.},

To understand the consequences of phenotypic plasticity it is necessary to study how changing a particular trait of an individual affects either its survival, growth, reproduction or a combination of these demographic vital rates (i.e. fitness components). Integrating vital rate changes due to phenotypic plasticity into models of population dynamics allows detailed study of how phenotypic changes scale up to higher levels of integration and forms an excellent tool to distinguish those plastic trait changes that really matter at the population level. A modeling approach also facilitates studying systems that are even more complex: traits and vital rates often co-vary or trade-off with other traits that may show plastic responses over environmental gradients. Here we review recent developments in the literature on population models that attempt to include phenotypic plasticity with a range of evolutionary assumptions and modeling techniques. We present in detail a model framework in which environmental impacts on population dynamics can be followed analytically through direct and indirect pathways that importantly incorporate phenotypic plasticity, trait-trait and trait-vital rate relationships. We illustrate this framework with two case studies: the population-level consequences of phenotypic responses to nutrient enrichment of plant species occurring in nutrient-poor habitats and of responses to changes in flooding regimes due to climate change. We conclude with exciting prospects for further development of this framework: selection analyses, modeling advances and the inclusion of spatial dynamics by considering dispersal traits as well. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

  abstract = {In freshwater systems located in agricultural areas, organisms are exposed to a multitude of toxicologically and structurally different pesticides. For regulatory purposes it is of major importance whether the combined hazard of these substances can be predictively assessed from the single substance toxicity. For artificially designed multi-component mixtures, it has been shown that the mixture toxicity can be predicted by concentration addition (CA) in case of similarly acting substances and by independent action (IA), if mixtures are composed of dissimilarly acting substances. This study aimed to analyse whether these concepts may also be used to predictively assess the toxicity of environmentally realistic mixtures. For this purpose a mixture of 25 pesticides, which reflects a realistic exposure scenario in field run-off water, was studied for its effects on the reproduction of the freshwater alga Scenedesmus vacuolatus. The toxicity of the tested mixtures showed a good predictability by CA. This is consistent with the finding that the toxicity was dominated by a group of similarly acting photosystem II inhibitors, although the mixture included substances with diverse and partly unknown mechanisms of action. IA slightly underestimated the actual mixture toxicity. However, the EC 50 values that can be derived from each prediction, according to CA respectively IA, only differed by a factor of 1.3. The finding of such a small difference is partly explainable by the fact that only few components dominate the mixture scenario in terms of so-called toxic units (TUs). This connection is established by developing an equation that allows to calculate the maximum possible ratio between corresponding predictions of effect concentrations by IA and CA for any given ratio of the TUs of mixture components, irrespective of their individual concentration-response functions and independent from their mechanisms of action. To evaluate whether small quantitative differences between EC50 values predicted by CA and IA are an exception or rather the rule for agricultural exposure scenarios, this calculation was applied on an additional set of 18 pesticide exposure scenarios that were taken from the literature. For these scenarios, EC50 values predicted by IA can never exceed those predicted by CA by more than a factor of 2.5. The findings of this study support the view that CA provides a precautious but not overprotective approach to the predictive hazard assessment of pesticide mixtures under realistic exposure scenarios, irrespective of the similarity or dissimilarity of their mechanisms of action. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We utilized 22 strains of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila to determine if different phenotypic dispersal strategies co-exist within a species and which mechanisms underlie this variability. We quantified the cell morphologies impacting cell motility and dispersal. Distinct differences in innate cellular morphology and dispersal rates were detected, but no universally utilized combinations of morphological parameters correlate with dispersal. Rather, multiple distinct and plastic morphological changes impact cilia-dependent motility during dispersal, especially in proficient dispersing strains facing challenging environmental conditions. Combining ecology and cell biology experiments, we show that dispersal can be promoted through plastic motility-associated changes to cell morphology and motile cilia.},

In this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate Paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). Broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas putida. Micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. Predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed by using a Perl program described here. Grazing preference of P. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. In competitive feeding trials, P. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than FP (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. Within-species size selection was also observed, but only for P. putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of P. putida were grazed preferentially. No significant difference in clearance rate was observed between GFP- and RFP-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and GFP-labeled strains. In contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or RFP-labeled cells.},

We tested this in the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocoptes medius), a non-migratory, low-dispersal habitat specialist associated with old deciduous forests of the Western Palearctic. We present the first phylogeographic study of this species integrating genetic data (three mitochondrial loci, one autosomal and one Z-linked intron) with species distribution modelling. Based on this species' ecology, we predicted that the middle spotted woodpecker could have colonized its current range from multiple Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refugia and that strongly structured populations could be expected. Indeed, we discovered a strong genetic divergence between Asian and European populations, with a split estimated at around one million of years ago. This was surprising given only slight intraspecific variation in plumage and morphology. Although there was no significant phylogeographic structure within the Asian and European groups, we cannot exclude the possibility of multiple refugia within either group during the LGM. This has to be further investigated with more extensive geographic sampling and larger number of variable independently evolving markers. Future studies should also investigate potential differences in vocalizations and ecology between the two groups. Lineages showing similar level of genetic differentiation including woodpeckers are often treated as species-level taxa. Comparison of our results with the phylogeographic history of other woodpeckers, suggests that sympatric species with similar life-histories might have idiosyncratic phylogeographic patterns probably resulting from different ecological requirements or historic stochasticity. \textcopyright{} 2018 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences}

Beyond potential negative effects of climate change such as decreasing productivity due to an increasing number of drought periods and damages from intensified disturbance regimes, there is also a potential for increasing productivity due to prolonged vegetation periods and higher photosynthetic rates. Quantitative genetic variation is crucial for adaptability of species towards environmental changes. The use of suitable reproductive material for forest regeneration will be a key factor essential for both, mitigating negative effects and making the most of potential positive effects. Therefore, insights into intraspecific variation within and among tree populations in climate response are of paramount importance.In our study we investigated intraspecific variation in climate response among Norway spruce (Picea abies) populations in the eastern Alpine range. Results from a comprehensive Austrian provenance test, comprising tree heights at age 15 from 379 populations planted at 29 test sites across Austria, were used to calibrate climate response functions for groups of Norway spruce populations. Potential future changes in productivity for climate change conditions as represented by a regionalized A1B scenario were estimated using height at age 15 as a productivity proxy. Climate response functions were calculated for single populations and aggregated clusters of populations from climatically similar origins.Our results hardly revealed any declines in employed proxies for productivity of Norway spruce throughout its current distribution range in Austria. For most parts of Austria an increase of tree heights up to 45 percent can be expected until 2080. However, the impact of a warming climate is different for individual population groups. Generally, variation in climate response increases with higher temperatures and less precipitation. Thus, an optimized choice of seed material according to prospective future climate conditions has the potential for an additional increase of productivity up to 11 percent.In general, populations from currently warm and drought prone areas seem to be well adapted to respective climate conditions and may be appropriate candidates for extended utilization in future. Furthermore, populations showing the best productivity indices originate from regions, which are phylogenetically distinct from the core distribution area of Norway spruce, suggesting that population history might explain part of the variation in climate response among populations. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Our findings show that predators boost the number of causal interactions among community members, and lead to reduced dynamic stability, but higher coexistence among prey species. These results correspond to time-varying changes in species interactions, including emergence of morphological characteristics that appeared to reduce predation, and indirectly facilitate growth of predator-susceptible species. Jointly, our findings suggest that careful consideration of both context and time may be necessary to predict and explain outcomes in multi-trophic systems.},

The estimated lag time between initial introduction and maximal population size is 5 times shorter for D. polymorpha than for D. r. bugensis, which may be an important factor affecting the speed with which this species can spread.

Today many more waterbodies are invaded by zebra mussels, and therefore the extent of their impact is greater than that of quagga mussels. Both species provide additional space and food for invertebrates in the littoral zone, increasing their diversity and density. In contrast, in the profundal zone, quagga mussels may compete for space and food resources with benthic invertebrates, decreasing their diversity and density. The system-wide effect of dreissenids depends on water mixing rates, lake morphology, and turnover rates. Because quagga mussels are found in all regions of a lake, and form larger populations, they may filter larger volumes of water and may have greater system-wide effects, especially in deep lakes, than zebra mussels, which are restricted to shallower portions of lakes. Shortly after initial invasion, as populations increase, both dreissenids will have their largest effects on communities, and most of them will be direct effects. After the initial stage of invasion, impacts are less predictable, and more likely to be caused by indirect effects through changes in the ecosystem.},

First, seed dispersing, insect eating, and pollinating guilds were more resilient to low-intensity land use than high-intensity land use. Compared with forest assemblages, bird abundance, species richness, and diversity were all {$\sim$}15\% lower in low-intensity land use and {$\sim$}50\% lower in high-intensity land use. Second, patterns in species richness generally correlated with patterns in stability: guilds exhibited less variation in abundance in low-intensity land use than in high-intensity land use. Finally, interspecific differences in reaction to environmental change (response diversity) and possibly the portfolio effect, but not negative covariance of species abundances, conferred resilience and stability. These findings point to the changes needed in agricultural production practices in the tropics to better sustain bird communities and, possibly, the functional and service roles that they play.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts and recent study revealed that depth of the thermocline can strongly influence the nutrient availability and composition of plankton communities. We are focused on the effect of metalimnetic gradients on water chemistry and plankton communities in three stratified lakes with different trophic conditions. Vertical changes in water chemistry revealed significant increase of macroelement concentrations in the metalimnion of all studied lakes. However, there was no significant increase of nutrient concentrations in the thermocline of lakes with smoother metalimnetic gradient, whereas sharp and deep thermocline zone caused higher concentration of orthophosphates and dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the metalimnion. The maximum concentrations of phytoplankton were observed just below the thermocline and were caused mostly by the abundance of diatoms and cryptophytes. Vertical distribution of the crustacean zooplankton was similar to the distribution of phytoplankton. Especially, Daphnia cucullata was strongly related with the phytoplankton distribution and reached maximum densities in deep layers with high chlorophyll concentrations, and, conversely, smaller crustacean species and rotifers were not affected by the vertical distribution of phytoplankton.},

These projections were then used to drive four effect models linked to assess the effects on hydrology, and nitrogen (N) concentrations and fluxes, in the Bjerkreim river basin (685-km2) and its coastal fjord, southwestern Norway. The four effect models were the hydrological model HBV, the water quality models MAGIC, INCA-N and the NIVA FJORD model. The downscaled climate scenarios project a general temperature increase in the study region of approximately 1 \textdegree C by 2030-2049 (MPI IS92a) and approximately 3 \textdegree C by 2071-2100 (HAD A2). Both scenarios imply increased winter precipitation, whereas the projections of summer and autumn precipitation are quite different, with the MPI scenario projecting a slight increase and the HAD scenario a significant decrease. As a response to increased winter temperature, the HBV model simulates a dramatic reduction of snow accumulation in the upper parts of the catchment, which in turn lead to higher runoff during winter and lower runoff during snowmelt in the spring. With the HAD scenario, runoff in summer and early autumn is substantially reduced as a result of reduced precipitation, increased temperatures and thereby increased evapotranspiration. The water quality models, MAGIC and INCA-N project no major changes in nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and fluxes within the MPI scenario, but a significant increase in concentrations and a 40-50\% increase in fluxes in the HAD scenario. As a consequence, the acidification of the river could increase, thus offsetting ongoing recovery from acidification due to reductions in acid deposition. Additionally, the increased N loading may stimulate growth of N-limited benthic algae and macrophytes along the river channels and lead to undesirable eutrophication effects in the estuarine area. Simulations made by the FJORD model and the HAD scenario indicate that primary production in the estuary might increase up to 15-20\%, based on the climate-induced changes in river flow and nitrate concentrations alone. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A good understanding of the mechanisms and magnitude of the impact of invasive alien species on ecosystem services and biodiversity is a prerequisite for the efficient prioritisation of actions to prevent new invasions or for developing mitigation measures. In this review, we identified alien marine species that have a high impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity in European seas, classified the mechanisms of impact, commented on the methods applied for assessing the impact and the related inferential strength, and reported on gaps in available information. Furthermore, we have proposed an updated inventory of 87 marine species in Europe, representing 13 phyla, which have a documented high impact on ecosystem services or biodiversity.\textbackslash nFood provision was the ecosystem service that was impacted by the greatest number of alien species (in terms of both positive and negative impacts). Following food provision, the ecosystem services that were negatively affected by the highest number of alien species were ocean nourishment, recreation and tourism, and lifecycle maintenance, while the ecosystem services that were most often positively impacted were cognitive benefits, water purification, and climate regulation. In many cases, marine aliens were found to impact keystone/protected species and habitats. Thirty percent of the assessed species had an impact on entire ecosystem processes or wider ecosystem functioning, more often in a negative fashion. Forty-nine of the assessed species were reported as being ecosystem engineers, which fundamentally modify, create, or define habitats by altering their physical or chemical properties.\textbackslash nThe positive impacts of alien species are probably underestimated, as there is often a perception bias against alien species. Among the species herein assessed as high-impact species, 17 had only negative and 7 only positive impacts; for the majority (63 species), both negative and positive impacts were reported; the overall balance was often unknown. Although there is no doubt that invasive species have modified marine ecosystems, evidence for most of the reported impacts is weak, as it is based on expert judgement or dubious correlations, while only 13\% of the reported impacts were inferred via manipulative or natural experiments. A need for stronger inference is evident, to improve our knowledge base of marine biological invasions and better inform environmental managers.},

  abstract = {Plant traits - the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs - determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69000 out of the world's 300000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

With recurrence, TIC can be more severe and may increase the risk for sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE We postulate that negative remodeling persists even though ejection fraction (EF) normalizes after appropriate treatment in these patients. METHODS We analyzed 2-dimensional echocardiographic parameters of 24 patients with TIC (male: 21; age: 64.1 +/- 15.2 years; atrial arrhythmias: 92\%) that improved significantly with treatment (mean time between pretreatment and posttreatment echocardiography: 14 +/- 6 months) and compared them with that of age-, gender-, and ejection fraction-matched control subjects without a history of TIC. RESULTS The majority of posttreatment echocardiographic parameters showed a significant improvement (P \textexclamdown{} .05) with treatment in patients with TIC, including left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (31.2\% +/- 8.2\% to 55.0\% +/- 5.7\%) and LV end systolic volume index (55 +/- 21 ml/m(2) to 33 +/- 13 ml/m(2)). There was no significant difference in LV end diastolic volume index (78 +/- 22 ml/m(2) to 72 +/- 22 ml/m(2), p = .15). However, when compared with age-, gender-, and ejection fraction-matched control subjects, posttreatment echocardiographic parameters in TIC patients showed significant differences (TIC vs control group) in LV end systolic volume index (33 +/- 13 ml/m(2) vs 22 +/- 5 ml/m(2)), LV end diastolic volume index (72 +/- 22 ml/m(2) vs 51 +/- 12 ml/m(2)), and cardiac index (2.6 +/- 0.8 l/min/m(2) vs 1.8 +/- 0.6 l/min/m(2)). CONCLUSION Although the majority of echocardiographic parameters, including EF, improved significantly with treatment in TIC patients, LV dimensions and volumes remained significantly elevated when compared with control subjects, indicating persistence of negative LV remodeling, even after appropriate treatment and normalization of EF at a mean follow-up of 14 months.},

Desert dust is a main source of nutrients to oceanic biota and the Amazon forest, but it deteriorates air quality, as shown for Florida. Dust affects the Earth radiation budget, thus participating in climate change and feedback mechanisms. There is an urgent need for new tools for quantitative evaluation of the dust distribution, transport, and deposition. The Terra spacecraft, launched at the dawn of the last millennium, provides the first systematic well-calibrated multispectral measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS) instrument for daily global analysis of aerosol. MODIS data are used here to distinguish dust from smoke and maritime aerosols and to evaluate the African dust column concentration, transport, and deposition. We found that 240 80 Tg of dust are transported annually from Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, 140 40 Tg are deposited in the Atlantic Ocean, 50 Tg fertilize the Amazon Basin four times as previous estimates, thus explaining a paradox regarding the source of nutrition to the Amazon forest), 50 Tg reach the Caribbean, and 20 Tg return to Africa and Europe. The results are compared favorably with dust transport models for maximum particle diameter between 6 and 12 mm. This study is a first example of quantitative use of MODIS aerosol for a geophysical research.},

We compared two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical support for the use of track count data to estimate population density rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance. Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast, animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research process. The track survey cost 40\% less than the aerial survey, and could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However, in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to conservation beyond improved data.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved. Zooplankton is an important element of the structure and function of freshwater lake ecosystems, while the study of changes in abundance, species diversity and composition in zooplankton communities can provide important indications of long term environmental changes. The present study provides elements on the community structure, the spatial and seasonal variation and the relation of zooplankton to environmental parameters in four natural lakes (Trichonis, Amvrakia, Lysimachia and Ozeros) and one reservoir (Stratos) situated in western Greece. Zooplankton surveys of 12 to 24 months were conducted between 2003 and 2010, while at the same time the most important physicochemical parameters were recorded. The number of species in the five lakes varied between 25 (Ozeros) and 36 (Lysimachia). The general similarities in species composition in the five lakes can be attributed to their common geological origin, while differences among them are ought either to geographical isolation, to the particular water chemistry, or to their trophic state. The group of copepods, and especially the calanoid Eudiaptomus drieschi, dominated the zooplankton community in the oligotrophic Trichonis Lake, the oligo-mesotrophic Amvrakia Lake and the meso- eutrophic Ozeros Lake. Instead, the group of rotifers dominated in the eutrophic Lysimachia Lake and in Stratos reservoir. The cladoceran species presented clear seasonal dominance succession patterns, with Bosmina longirostris and Diaphanosoma orghidani occupying the greatest percentage in winter and summer months, respectively. The larvae of the mollusk Dreissena blanci were important constituent on the zooplankton community in most of the lakes, except Lysimachia. In the deep lakes Trichonis and Amvrakia, the higher zooplankton density was recorded in the surface 0-20 m layer and was decreasing with depth, while small numbers of zooplankton specimens were found also in the hypoxic/anoxic hypolimnion of the latter lake. The vertical separation of the numerically most important species of crustaceans and rotifers is attributed possibly to the reduction of intra- and inter-specific competition. Temperature was the most important environmental parameter for most of the species variation, while other elements like dissolved oxygen, water level fluctuation, conductivity, chlorophyll-a and nutrients concentration played also important role in the zooplankton spatial and temporal distribution in the five lakes.},

We examined changes in fish assemblages across a network of marine reserves and two different types of partially-protected areas within a marine park over the first 5 years of its establishment. We used Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) to quantify fish communities on rocky reefs at 20-40 m depth between 2008-2011. Each year, we sampled 12 sites in 6 no-take marine reserves and 12 sites in two types of partially-protected areas with contrasting levels of protection (n = 4 BRUV stations per site). Fish abundances were 38\% greater across the network of marine reserves compared to the partially-protected areas, although not all individual reserves performed equally. Compliance actions were positively associated with marine reserve responses, while reserve size had no apparent relationship with reserve performance after 5 years. The richness and abundance of fishes did not consistently differ between the two types of partially-protected areas. There was, therefore, no evidence that the more regulated partially-protected areas had additional conservation benefits for reef fish assemblages. Overall, our results demonstrate conservation benefits to fish assemblages from a newly established network of temperate marine reserves. They also show that ecological monitoring can contribute to adaptive management of newly established marine reserve networks, but the extent of this contribution is limited by the rate of change in marine communities in response to protection.Copyright:\textcopyright 2014 Greene et al.},

Sediment yields, virtually all coming from sediment resuspension, were significantly correlated with average wind speeds, though periods of extreme winds also played a role. Sediment resuspension rates for Lake Markermeer were high, viz. on average ca. 1,000 g m -2 day -1. The highly dynamic nature of Lake Markermeer sediments must be due to the overall shallowness of the lake, together with its large surface area (dynamic ratio = [{$\surd$}(area)]/[average depth] = 7.5); wind-induced waves and currents will impact most of the lake's sediment bed. Indeed, near-bed currents can easily reach values \textquestiondown 10 cm/s. Measurements of the thickness of the settled "mud" layer, as well as 137Cs dating, showed that long-term deposition only takes place in the deeper SE area of the lake. Finally, lake sediment dynamics were investigated in preliminary laboratory experiments in a small "micro-flume", applying increasing water currents onto five Lake Markermeer sediments. Sediment resuspension started off at 0.5-0.7 cm/s and showed a strongly exponential behaviour with respect to these currents. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Basel AG},

  abstract = {Predicting how freshwater biota respond to multiple stressors is currently a major challenge facing aquatic ecologists and environmental managers. Lake Simcoe is an ideal location to test the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota over time, as changes in climate warming, species invasions, nutrient loading, and human population growth have occurred throughout the last three decades. In this study, we used a suite of multivariate analyses to quantify the unique and interactive effects of physico-climatic, water quality, and biological variables in explaining phytoplankton community composition from 1986 to 2012. Changes in water quality, zooplankton abundance and community composition (following the invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus), euphotic zone temperature and thermal stability, and the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) acting at different times throughout the period of record, were associated with major shifts in the phytoplankton community of Lake Simcoe: dominance of eutrophic diatoms and cyanobacteria from 1986 to 1997 shifted to chlorophytes after 1998, then again to a diverse mix of taxa represented by all major categories of algae after 2004. Contrary to expectation, we found little evidence that interactions between multiple stressors are taking place in Lake Simcoe. Instead, our results demonstrated the sequential nature of multiple stressors in influencing interannual variation in phytoplankton community structure. By occurring consecutively over time, we propose a ``sequence of stressors'' has influenced the ecological health of the lake over the preceding three decades. Considered by category, biological stressors, followed by water quality, then temperature and climate, explained the largest amount of total variance in the phytoplankton data. The prominence of zooplankton community changes as significant predictors of phytoplankton community change throughout the period of record suggests the top-down effect of these herbivores are also very important. Our results highlight the importance of extensive ecosystem monitoring in determining ecosystem health. Our approach may assist in the management of other aquatic systems, where identifying when multiple stressors are not operating may simplify the management process, allowing remediation efforts to focus on the most impactful stressors as primary targets for ecosystem restoration.},

We quantified thermal preferences and then compared leaf-litter processing rates at eight different temperatures (5.0\textendash 22.5 \textdegree C) by the invasive freshwater crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus and the Great Britain native Gammarus pulex at a range of body sizes. D. villosus preferred warmer temperatures but there was considerable overlap in the range of temperatures that the two species occupied during preference trials. When matched for size, G. pulex had a greater leaf shredding efficiency than D. villosus, suggesting that invasion and subsequent displacement of the native amphipod will result in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, D. villosus is an inherently larger species and interspecific variation in shredding was reduced when animals of a representative size range were compared. D. villosus shredding rates increased at a faster rate than G. pulex with increasing temperature suggesting that climate change may offset some of the reduction in function. D. villosus, but not G. pulex, showed evidence of an ability to select those temperatures at which its shredding rate was maximised, and the activation energy for shredding in D. villosus was more similar to predictions from metabolic theory. While per capita and mass-corrected shredding rates were lower in the invasive D. villosus than the native G. pulex, our study provides novel insights in to how the interactive effects of metabolic function, body size, behavioural thermoregulation, and density produce antagonistic effects between anthropogenic stressors.},

In Prochlorococcus, there is a clear phylogenetic hierarchy of ecotypes, whereas multiple Synechococcus clades have overlapping physiologies and environmental distributions. However, microbial traits are associated with different phylogenetic depths. Using this principle, we reclassified diversity at different phylogenetic levels and compared the phylogeography. We sequenced the genetic diversity of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus from 339 samples across the tropical Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean using a highly variable phylogenetic marker gene (rpoC1). We observed clear parallel niche distributions of ecotypes leading to high Pianka's Index values driven by distinct shifts at two transition points. The first transition point at 6\textdegree N distinguished ecotypes adapted to warm waters but separated by macronutrient content. At 39\textdegree N, ecotypes adapted to warm, low macronutrient vs. colder, high macronutrient waters shifted. Finally, we detected parallel vertical and regional single-nucleotide polymorphism microdiversity within clades from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, suggesting uniquely adapted populations at very specific depths, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Overall, this study demonstrates that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have shared phylogenetic organization of traits and associated phylogeography.},

Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant communities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and subordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and community-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assemblages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abundance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P concentrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and highlights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in community-level processes. \textcopyright{} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Paleobiological data from the youngest sedimentary record, including death assemblages actively accumulating on modern land surfaces and seabeds, provide unique information on the status of present-day species, communities, and biomes over the last few decades to millennia and on their responses to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Key advances have established the accuracy and resolving power of paleobiological information derived from naturally preserved remains and of proxy evidence for environmental conditions and sample age so that fossil data can both implicate and exonerate human stressors as the drivers of biotic change and permit the effects of multiple stressors to be disentangled. Legacy effects from Industrial and even pre-Industrial anthropogenic extirpations, introductions, (de)nutrification, and habitat conversion commonly emerge as the primary factors underlying the present-day status of populations and communities; within the last 2 million years, climate change has rarely been sufficient to drive major extinction pulses absent other human pressures, which are now manifold. Young fossil records also provide rigorous access to the baseline composition and dynamics of modern-day biota under pre-Industrial conditions, where insights include the millennial-scale persistence of community structures, the dominant role of physical environmental conditions rather than biotic interactions in determining community composition and disassembly, and the existence of naturally alternating states.},

  abstract = {Here, we introduce and present modern statistical approaches that allow us to simulate the distribution or abundance and density of species, populations or habitats in space. The methods we present are based on regression techniques, and they all have in common that they explain and predict the presence or abundance of species as a function of one or many site factors (elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, precipitation, soil type, etc.). In general, we aim at predicting a biotic variable (e.g. presence) as a function of explanatory variables. Therefore we call the biotic variable as dependent variable and the predictors as independent variables. Yet, several terminologies exist in the scientific literature (see list): Dependent Independent response variable explanatory variable dependent variable independent variable This dichotomy reflects the logics of regression analyses where a response variable is considered " dependent " of explanatory (or independent) variables. The independent variables are considered uninfluenced by the dependent variable, meaning that there is no immediate feedback. Yet, this dichotomy reflects also the biological logics of the regression modeling approach. We attempt to explain e.g. the presence of a species from biotic and abiotic site factors. Therefore the presence of a species is considered a physiological or mechanistic logic of these site factors, or in other words a causal function of the explanatory variables based on the niche requirements of a species. The regression itself does NOT distinguish between correlative and causal relationships. As soon as a variable is significant in a regression, it can be seen as a statistical predictor, even if the " biological explanation " is irrelevant or wrong. Thus, it largely depends on the experimental design and context, if we can talk about causal or correlative relationships. A recently developed classification of ecological models follows a similar logic. We also distinguish between mechanistic and empirical models. But a third group of models is distinguished, called mathematical or analytical (see figure).},

These effects appear to be mediated by changes in the observed variation of traits and differential sensitivity to stressors among phenotypes. Considering that wild animals routinely face a range of biotic and abiotic stressors, increased knowledge of these effects is imperative for understanding the causal mechanisms of a range of ecological phenomena and evolutionary responses to stressors associated with environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2013.},

Rapid genetic adaptation of resident populations founded by early colonists to local conditions might prevent establishment of later-arriving lineages, resulting in an evolution-mediated priority effect. This might result in a limited window of opportunity for establishment during which the resident population did not have sufficient time yet to monopolize the patch through local adaptation. The length of this window of opportunity is expected to depend on the degree to which early colonists and immigrants are preadapted to local habitat conditions. We present an intraspecific competition model of the initial transient population and evolutionary dynamics that quantifies the window of opportunity for establishment for asexual species. The model explicitly addresses the long-lasting effects of evolution-mediated priority effects by tracking lineages through time. Our results show that the difference in initial preadaptation between early colonists and late immigrants and the speed of evolution codetermine the window of opportunity for establishment. Our results also suggest that local populations should often be dominated by descendants of just a few early colonist lineages and that landscape genetic structure should often reflect the legacy of colonization history.},

We propose a hypothesis that predicts a U-shaped relationship between density and both natal and breeding dispersal distance. Using 10 years of observations on a breeding colony of the Blue-footed Booby (Sulci nebouxii), the hypothesis was confirmed by documenting simultaneous positive and negative density-dependent dispersal distances in natal and breeding dispersal of males and breeding dispersal of females within the colony. Point-pattern analyses demonstrated that the breeding sites of Blue-footed Boobies were highly aggregated in all years within a large study area, and aggregation presumably resulted in heterogeneity in patch density throughout the colony. As predicted, at moderate to high densities, dispersal distances showed positive density dependence, with individuals moving to lower density patches. In contrast, at low to moderate densities, dispersal distances showed negative density dependence, with individuals moving to higher density patches. In both sexes of the 1994 cohort, the higher the mean density in patches used by an individual over the long term (up to age 11 years), the fewer fledglings it produced. A positive effect of density on long-term reproductive success was not detected, possibly because birds that failed during pair formation or incubation were not sampled. Density of conspecifics may be an important influence on habitat selection of breeders, and dispersal may tend to carry individuals to patches where pair formation opportunities are better and negative effects of competition on reproductive success are reduced. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, measuring the impact of viral infection on PSII function in E. huxleyi populations from natural, taxo nomically diverse phytoplankton communities is difficult, and whether this phenomenon occurs in nature is presently unknown. Here, chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was used to assess changes in PSII efficiency throughout an E. huxleyi bloom during a mesocosm experiment off the coast of Norway. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether a measurable suppression of the efficiency of PSII photochemistry could be observed due to viral infection of the natural E. huxleyi populations. During the major infection period prior to bloom collapse, there was a significant reduction in PSII efficiency with an average decrease in maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of 17\% and a corresponding 75\% increase in maximum PSII effective absorption crosssection (sPSII); this was concurrent with a significant decrease in E. huxleyi growth rates and an increase in E. huxleyi virus (EhV) production. As E. huxleyi populations dominated the phytoplankton community and potentially contributed up to 100\% of the chlorophyll a pool, we believe that the variable chlorophyll fluorescence signal measured during this period was derived predominantly from E. huxleyi and, thus, reflects changes occurring within E. huxleyi cells. This is the first demonstration of suppression of PSII photochemistry occurring during viral infection of natural coccolithophore populations. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2014.},

Bdelloids reproduce only asexually, whereas most monogononts are cyclical parthenogens. We explore some of the adaptive consequences of these life-history differences using a computer model to simulate the evolutionary acquisition of new beneficial mutations. A one-locus mutation-selection regime based on the life-history characteristics of bdelloids indicates that asexuals can maintain higher levels of both allelic and genotypic diversity over a longer time period than obligate sexuals. These results are produced by differences in the magnitude of random genetic drift (RGD) associated with the different types of reproduction. Cyclical parthenogens have significantly higher evolutionary rates than sexual forms in a single-locus model, but incorporate beneficial mutations more slowly than sexuals in a two-locus simulation. Our results are therefore strongly influenced by the number of loci being evaluated as well as the pattern of reproduction. The asexual life history was found to maintain higher levels of allelic diversity than any pattern including sexual reproduction. This intriguing finding is amplified as the number of loci undergoing selection is increased. We end by considering the adaptive consequences of the remarkably divergent life histories found in typical bdelloid and monogonont rotifers. \textcopyright{} Springer 2005.},

  abstract = {Turbulence may enhance contact rates between planktonic predators and their prey. We formulate simple and general models of prey encounter rates, taking into account the behaviours and motility patterns of both prey and predator as well as turbulent fluid motion. Using these models we determine the levels of turbulence (as dissipation rate) at which ambient fluid motion is important in enhancing prey encounter rates for various types of predators (e.g. ambush and cruise predators, suspension feeders). Generally, turbulence has the largest effect on prey encounters for predators with low motility and long reaction distances. Also, turbulence is most important for meso-sized (mm to cm) predators and insignificant for smaller and larger predators. The effect of turbulence on copepods is specifically examined. For copepods that establish feeding currents, turbulence is of minor importance; for ambush feeding copepods, such as Acartidae and many cyclopoids, turbulence has a dominant influence on prey encounter rates. The effect on cruising predators is intermediate. Application of the models to situations examined experimentally demonstrates a high predictive performance. Finally we explore and model the potentially negative effects of turbulence on copepod feeding currents, prey perception and capture success. At typical and even high turbulent intensities, none of these is significantly affected.}

  abstract = {Zooplankton is a morphologically and taxonomically diverse group and includes organisms that vary in size by many orders of magnitude, but they are all faced with the common problem of collecting food from a very dilute suspension. In order to maintain a viable population in the face of mortality, zooplankton in the ocean have to clear daily a volume of ambient water for prey particles that is equivalent to about 106 times their own body volume. While most size-specific vital rates and mortality rates decline with size, the clearance requirement is largely size-independent because food availability also declines with size. There is a limited number of solutions to the problem of concentrating dilute prey from a sticky medium: passive and active ambush feeding; feeding-current feeding, where the prey is either intercepted directly, retained on a filter, or individually perceived and extracted from the feeding current; cruise feeding; and colonization of large particles and marine snow aggregates. The basic mechanics of these food-collection mechanisms are described, and it is shown that their efficiencies are inherently different and that each of these mechanisms becomes less efficient with increasing size. Mechanisms that compensate for this decline in efficiency are described, including inflation of feeding structures and development of vision. Each feeding mode has implications beyond feeding in terms of risk of encountering predators and chance of meeting mates, and they partly target different types of prey. The main dichotomy is between (inefficient) ambush feeding on motile prey and the more efficient active feeding modes; a secondary dichotomy is between (efficient) hovering and (less efficient) cruising feeding modes. The efficiencies of the various feeding modes are traded off against feeding-mode-dependent metabolic expenses, predation risks, and mating chances. The optimality of feeding strategies, evaluated as the ratio of gain over risk, varies with the environment, and may explain both size-dependent and spatio-temporal differences in distributions of various feeding types as well as other aspects of the biology of zooplankton (mating behaviour, predator defence strategies).},

We applied network analyses to intra- and interspecific movement patterns in the migration behaviour and dam passage success of two anadromous fish species, Pacific lamprey Entosphenus tridentatus Gairdner and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha Walbaum, when moving through a large multifishway hydroelectric project (Bonneville Dam, USA). Network analyses revealed greater variation in movement for Pacific lamprey compared with Chinook salmon. Salmon that passed the dam had networks consisting of more direct passage routes with fewer overall movements compared with lamprey that passed the dam. Lamprey that did not pass the dam exhibited a wide range of behaviours, from approaching only one fishway site to testing all possible passage routes. Accounting for the time spent in the network improved the ability to detect biological differences in network structure for lamprey that did and did not pass the dam. The movement patterns likely resulted from different behavioural responses to complex environmental and internal factors affecting a philopatric species (Chinook salmon) vs. a non-philopatric species (Pacific lamprey) when moving through an engineered environment designed primarily for salmon. Synthesis and applications. Our case study highlights the potential for network analyses to link questions of basic movement ecology with monitoring of movement and behaviour in human-altered landscapes. Network analyses can thus serve as a valuable tool for describing movement and behaviour in the face of environmental change and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation efforts at spatially complex obstacles to animal movement. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

Twenty-five lakes were infested with dreissenid mussels (invaded), while 25 lakes were dreissenid free (uninvaded). In invaded lakes, phytoplankton biomass was 24\% lower, and water clarity was 21\% greater. Total microzooplankton biomass was 44\% lower, with ciliate and rotifer biomass 39\% and 45\% lower, respectively, in invaded lakes. Total macrozooplankton biomass was 33\% lower, largely driven by a 40\% lower biomass of Daphnia spp. in invaded lakes. In contrast, dreissenid status had no significant influence on total copepod biomass, calanoid biomass, or cyclopoid biomass. Our microzooplankton results are similar to those of previous studies conducted in shallow, well-mixed systems, although the magnitude of the dreissenid influence in our study was smaller, as might be expected in thermally stratified systems. On the other hand, ours is the first study to document lower biomass of Daphnia spp. and reduced rotifer diversity in invaded lakes. In contrast, we found no difference in macrozooplankton community structure. Dreissenids likely affected zooplankton directly through predation (microzooplankton) and indirectly through resource competition (micro- and macrozooplankton). Understanding how dreissenid mussels affect both micro- and macrozooplankton will help us to identify the potential mechanisms by which higher trophic levels (e.g., fish) are influenced by these invaders.},

  abstract = {Species can adjust their traits in response to selection which may strongly influence species coexistence. Nevertheless, current theory mainly assumes distinct and time-invariant trait values. We examined the combined effects of the range and the speed of trait adaptation on species coexistence using an innovative multispecies predator\textendash prey model. It allows for temporal trait changes of all predator and prey species and thus simultaneous coadaptation within and among trophic levels. We show that very small or slow trait adaptation did not facilitate coexistence because the stabilizing niche differences were not sufficient to offset the fitness differences. In contrast, sufficiently large and fast trait adaptation jointly promoted stable or neutrally stable species coexistence. Continuous trait adjustments in response to selection enabled a temporally variable convergence and divergence of species traits; that is, species became temporally more similar (neutral theory) or dissimilar (niche theory) depending on the selection pressure, resulting over time in a balance between niche differences stabilizing coexistence and fitness differences promoting competitive exclusion. Furthermore, coadaptation allowed prey and predator species to cluster into different functional groups. This equalized the fitness of similar species while maintaining sufficient niche differences among functionally different species delaying or preventing competitive exclusion. In contrast to previous studies, the emergent feedback between biomass and trait dynamics enabled supersaturated coexistence for a broad range of potential trait adaptation and parameters. We conclude that accounting for trait adaptation may explain stable and supersaturated species coexistence for a broad range of environmental conditions in natural systems when the absence of such adaptive changes would preclude it. Small trait changes, coincident with those that may occur within many natural populations, greatly enlarged the number of coexisting species.},

He argued that this was neither a coincidence, nor the result of the plankton adapting to the oceanic stoichiometry, but rather that phytoplankton adjust the N:P stoichiometry of the ocean to meet their requirements through nitrogen fixation, an idea supported by recent modelling studies3,4. But what determines the N:P requirements of phytoplankton? Here we use a stoichiometrically explicit model of phytoplankton physiology and resource competition to derive from first principles the optimal phytoplankton stoichiometry under diverse ecological scenarios. Competitive equilibrium favours greater allocation to P-poor resource-acquisition machinery and therefore a higher N:P ratio; exponential growth favours greater allocation to P-rich assembly machinery and therefore a lower N:P ratio. P-limited environments favour slightly less allocation to assembly than N-limited or light-limited environments. The model predicts that optimal N:P ratios will vary from 8.2 to 45.0, depending on the ecological conditions. Our results show that the canonical Redfield N:P ratio of 16 is not a universal biochemical optimum, but instead represents an average of species-specific N:P ratios.},

Previous studies suggested that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the numerically dominant phytoplankton in the oceans, have different responses to elevated CO2 that may result in a dramatic shift in their relative abundances in future oceans. Here we showed that the exponential growth rates of these two genera respond to future CO2 conditions in a manner similar to other cyanobacteria, but Prochlorococcus strains had significantly lower realized growth rates under elevated CO2 regimes due to poor survival after exposure to fresh culture media. Despite this, a Synechococcus strain was unable to outcompete a Prochlorococcus strain in co-culture at elevated CO2. Under these conditions, Prochlorococcus' poor response to elevated CO2 disappeared, and Prochlorococcus' relative fitness showed negative frequency dependence, with both competitors having significant fitness advantages when initially rare. These experiments suggested that the two strains should be able to coexist indefinitely in co-culture despite sharing nearly identical nutritional requirements. We speculate that negative frequency dependence exists due to reductive Black Queen evolution that has resulted in a passively mutualistic relationship analogous to that connecting Prochlorococcus with the `helper' heterotrophic microbes in its environment.},

However, little is known about how changing environmental conditions and anthropogenic pollution can affect aquatic communities in combination. We investigated the influence of short warming periods on the response of a zooplankton community to the insecticide esfenvalerate at a range of environmentally realistic concentrations (0.03, 0.3 and 3 {$\mu$}g L(-1) ) in 55 outdoor pond microcosms. Warming periods increased the cumulative water temperature, but did not exceed the maximum temperature measured under ambient conditions. Under warming conditions alone the abundance of some zooplankton taxa increased selectively compared to ambient conditions. This resulted in a shift in the community composition that had not recovered by the end of the experiment, 8 weeks after the last warming period. Regarding the pesticide exposure, short-term effects of esfenvalerate on the community structure and the sensitive taxa Daphnia spp. did not differ between the two temperature regimes. In contrast, long-term effects of esfenvalerate on Daphnia spp., a taxon that did not benefit from elevated temperatures, were observed twice as long under warming than under ambient conditions. This resulted in long-term effects on Daphnia spp. until 4 months after contamination at 3 {$\mu$}g L(-1) esfenvalerate. Under both temperature regimes, we identified strength of interspecific competition as the mechanism determining the time until recovery. However, enhanced interspecific competition under warming conditions was prolonged and explained the delayed recovery of Daphnia spp. from esfenvalerate. These results show that, for realistic prediction of the combined effects of changing environmental factors and toxicants on sensitive taxa, the impacts of stressors on the biotic interactions within the community need to be considered.},

Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs. Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent with temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the abundance of hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased microbial abundance.

This OA effect is a serious concern in SE Asia, which produces \textquestiondown 80\% of the world's oysters. Because climate-related stressors rarely act alone, we need to consider OA effect on oysters in combination with warming and reduced salinity. Here, the interactive effects of these three climate-related stressors on the larval growth of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were examined. Larvae were cultured in combinations of temperature (24oC and 30oC), pH (8.1 and 7.4), and salinity (15 psu and 25 psu) for 58 days to the early juvenile stage. Decreased pH (pH 7.4), elevated temperature (30oC) and reduced salinity (15 psu) significantly delayed pre- and post-settlement growth. Elevated temperature lowered the larval lipid index, a proxy for physiological quality, and negated the negative effects of decreased pH on attachment and metamorphosis only in a salinity of 25 psu. The negative effects of multiple stressors on larval metamorphosis were not due to reduced size or depleted lipid reserves at the time of metamorphosis. Our results supported the hypothesis that the C.gigas larvae are vulnerable to the interactions of OA with reduced salinity and warming in Yellow Sea coastal waters now and in the future.},

  abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource\textendash consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies demonstrate phenotypic and genetic changes in natural populations that are subject to climate change, and there is hope that some of these changes will contribute to avoiding species extinctions (`evolutionary rescue'). Here, we review theoretical models of rapid evolution in quantitative traits that can shed light on the potential for adaptation to a changing climate. Our focus is on quantitative-genetic models with selection for a moving phenotypic optimum. We point out that there is no one-to-one relationship between the rate of adaptation and population survival, because the former depends on relative fitness and the latter on absolute fitness. Nevertheless, previous estimates that sustainable rates of genetically based change usually do not exceed 0.1 haldanes (i.e., phenotypic standard deviations per generation) are probably correct. Survival can be greatly facilitated by phenotypic plasticity, and heritable variation in plasticity can further speed up genetic evolution. Multivariate selection and genetic correlations are frequently assumed to constrain adaptation, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on the geometric relationship between the fitness landscape and the structure of genetic variation. Similar conclusions hold for adaptation to shifting spatial gradients. Recent models of adaptation in multispecies communities indicate that the potential for rapid evolution is strongly influenced by interspecific competition.},

  abstract = {Under changing environmental conditions, intraspecific variation can potentially rescue populations from extinction. There are two principal sources of variation that may ultimately lead to population rescue: genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. We compared the potential for evolutionary rescue (through genetic diversity) and plastic rescue (through phenotypic plasticity) by analysing their differential ability to produce dynamical stability and persistence in model food webs. We also evaluated how rescue is affected by the trophic location of variation. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) plastic communities are more likely to exhibit stability and persistence than communities in which genetic diversity provides the same range of traits. (ii) Variation at the lowest trophic level promotes stability and persistence more than variation at higher levels. (iii) Communities with variation at two levels have greater probabilities of stability and persistence than communities with variation at only one level. We found that (i) plasticity promotes stability and persistence more than genetic diversity; (ii) variation at the second highest trophic level promotes stability and persistence more than variation at the autotroph level; and (iii) more than variation at two trophic levels. Our study shows that proper evaluation of the rescue potential of intraspecific variation critically depends on its origin and trophic location. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is often a limiting nutrient within freshwater and estuarine systems, thus excess inputs of P from anthropogenic activities (dominantly agriculture) can induce eutrophication in receiving water bodies. The sequestration of P within estuarine sediments is controlled by sorption and precipitation processes, which are impacted by local redox conditions and burial environment. Despite the global spread of oxygen depletion in coastal marine systems, P burial under reducing conditions remains poorly understood. We investigated P cycling in relation to iron (Fe) redox chemistry in sediments from the eutrophic Peel-Harvey Estuary in Western Australia, using a combination of porewater analysis, sequential chemical P extractions, synchrotron-based micro-scale X-ray fluorescence mapping and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and PO43-sorption experiments. The sediments represented redox regimes varying from strongly reducing, organic-rich sediments with little or no reactive Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides to oxygenated sediments that were enriched in reactive Fe(III) phases. Organic P and Fe-associated P were the main P burial phases, and the latter was quantitatively important even in sediments with an overall strongly reducing character. We attribute this to adsorption of P onto micro-scale Fe(III) oxyhydroxide enrichments and/or Fe-bearing clay minerals. The organic-rich sediments showed a strong decline in P contents with depth; P was released from organic matter and Fe phases but apatite precipitation was apparently inhibited in these sediments. Despite greater and stronger PO43-sorption capacity, the oxic sediments contained relatively little P due to a lack of the primary P source in marine sediments: organic matter. Our results provide detailed insight into P burial in dynamic estuarine sediments and show that micro-scale spectroscopic analyses greatly advance our understanding of P sequestration processes.},

  abstract = {Sedimentary burial of the essential nutrient phosphorus (P) under anoxic and sulfidic conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we use chemical and micro-scale spectroscopic methods to characterize sedimentary P burial along a water column redox transect (six stations, 78\textendash 2107 m water depth) in the Black Sea from the shelf with its oxygenated waters to the anoxic and sulfidic deep basin. Organic P is an important P pool under all redox regimes, accounting for up to 60\% of P burial. We find a general down-core increase in the relative importance of organic P, especially on the shelf where P bound to iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) (oxyhydr)oxides is abundant in the uppermost sediment but rapidly declines in concentration with sediment depth. Our chemical and spectroscopic data indicate that the carbonate-rich sediments (Unit I, {$\sim$}3000 years, {$\sim$}0\textendash 30 cm depth) of the sulfidic deep Black Sea contain three major P pools: calcium phosphate (apatite), organic P and P that is strongly associated with CaCO3and possibly clay surfaces. Apatite concentrations increase from 5\% to 25\% of total P in the uppermost centimeters of the deep basin sediments, highlighting the importance of apatite formation for long-term P burial. Iron(II)-associated P (ludlamite) was detected with X-ray absorption spectroscopy but was shown to be a minor P pool ({$\sim$}5\%), indicating that lateral Fe\textendash P transport from the shelf (``shuttling'') likely occurs but does not impact the P burial budget of the deep Black Sea. The CaCO3\textendash P pool was relatively constant throughout the Unit I sediment interval and accounted for up to 55\% of total P. Our results highlight that carbonate-bound P can be an important sink for P in CaCO3-rich sediments of anoxic, sulfidic basins and should also be considered as a potential P sink (and P source in case of CaCO3dissolution) when reconstructing past ocean P dynamics from geological records.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled fieldparameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

Models of coexistence often assume that species have fixed trait values and consider questions such as how tradeoffs and environmental variation influence coexistence and diversity. However, species traits can be dynamic, varying between populations and individuals and changing over time as species adapt and evolve, at rates that are relevant to ecological processes. Consequently, adding evolution to ecological coexistence models may modify their predictions and stability in complex or unexpected ways. We extend a well-studied coexistence mechanism depending on resource fluctuations by allowing evolution along a tradeoff between maximum growth rate and competitive ability. Interactions between favorable season length and the period of fluctuations constrain coexistence, with two species coexistence favored by intermediate season length and arising through evolutionary branching or non-local invasion. However, these results depend on the relative rates of ecological and evolutionary processes: rapid evolution leads to a complete breakdown of otherwise stable coexistence. Other coexistence mechanisms should be evaluated from an evolutionary perspective to examine how evolutionary forces may alter predicted ecological dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Members of these communities possess distinct environmental preferences, revealing widespread patterns of limiting similarity. This regularity leads to consistent changes in the structure of communities across fluctuation regimes. However, at high amplitudes, subtle differences in the form of fluctuations dramatically affect the collapse of communities.

  abstract = {Quantifying how environmental factors control the growth of phytoplankton communities is essential for building a mechanistic understanding of global biogeochemical cycles and aquatic food web dynamics. The strong effects of temperature on population growth rate have inspired two frameworks\textemdash the Eppley curve and the metabolic theory of ecology\textemdash that produce different quantitative relationships and employ distinct statistical approaches. Reconciling these relationships is necessary to ensure the accuracy of ecosystem models. In this paper, we develop ways to compare these frameworks, overcoming their methodological differences. Then, analyzing an extensive dataset ({$>$} 4200 growth rate measurements), we find that increases in population growth rate with temperature are consistent with metabolic theory, and weaker than previous estimates of the Eppley curve. A 10\textdegree C temperature increase will increase growth rates by a factor of 1.53, rather than 1.88 as in previous studies of the Eppley curve. Size and functional group membership are also critical. Population growth rates decrease with size, but much less strongly that metabolic theory predicts. The growth rates of different functional groups scale similarly with temperature, but some groups grow faster than others, independent of temperature. Our results reconcile the analytical methods of the Eppley curve and metabolic theory, demonstrate that metabolic theory's temperature-scaling predictions are more accurate, and provide new insights into the factors controlling phytoplankton growth. To avoid over-estimating the effects of temperature on primary productivity, the parameterization of ecosystem models should be revised.},

  abstract = {Environmental variability is ubiquitous, but its effects on populations are not fully understood or predictable. Recent attention has focused on how rapid evolution can impact ecological dynamics via adaptive trait change. However, the impact of trait change arising from plastic responses has received less attention, and is often assumed to optimize performance and unfold on a separate, faster timescale than ecological dynamics. Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               as it acclimates to temperature changes. First, we show that               C. reinhardtii               's gradual acclimation responses can both enhance and suppress its performance after a perturbation, depending on its prior thermal history. Second, we demonstrate that where conventional approaches fail to predict the population dynamics of               C. reinhardtii               exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasticity's interactions with ecological dynamics. Amidst the current emphasis on rapid evolution, it is critical that we also develop predictive methods accounting for plasticity.},

A variety of biological responses to ocean acidification have been measured across a range of taxa, but this information exists as case studies and has not been synthesized into meaningful comparisons amongst response variables and functional groups. We used meta-analytic techniques to explore the biological responses to ocean acidification, and found negative effects on survival, calcification, growth and reproduction. However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms. Calcifying organisms generally exhibited larger negative responses than non-calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected. Calcification responses varied significantly amongst organisms using different mineral forms of calcium carbonate. Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there was variation in the sensitivities of different developmental stages, but this variation was dependent on the taxonomic group. Our analyses suggest that the biological effects of ocean acidification are generally large and negative, but the variation in sensitivity amongst organisms has important implications for ecosystem responses.},

  abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature. \textcopyright{} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The area studied is a multi-municipal landfill in the northern Poland. The monitoring network of the landfill constitutes of 27piezometers for underground water monitoring and two observation points at surface water courses. After sampling, chemical analysis of various water parameters was performed (pH, conductivity, temperature, turbidity (TURB), color, taste, smell and atmospheric conditions: temperature, precipitation and cloud cover, heavy metals content (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr6+, Hg), total organic carbon (TOC), sum of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, alkalinity (Alkal), general hardness, total suspended matter (SUSP), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), chlorides, fluorides, sulphides, sulphates, ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, nitrate and nitrite nitrogen, volatile phenols, ether extracts (ETHER), dry residues (DRY\textsubscript{R}ES), dissolved compounds). Parallel to the chemical parameters assessment six different ecotoxicity tests were applied (\% root length(PG)/germination(PR) inhibition of Sorghum saccharatum (respectively PGSS/PRSS), Sinapis alba (respectively PGSA/PRSA), Lepidium sativum (respectively PGLS/PRLS), \% bioluminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri (MT), \% mortality of Daphnia magna (DM), \% mortality of Thamnocephalus platyrus (TN)). In order to determine the applicability of the various ecotoxicity tests, a ranking of samples from different monitoring levels according to the test used (attributes) is done by using HDT. Further, the sensitivity of the biotests was determined and compared. From the sensitivity analysis of the both monitoring levels was evident that the choice of ecotoxicity tests could be optimized by the use of HDT strategy. Most reliable results could be expected by the application of root growth inhibition of Sorghum saccharatum (PGSS test).In order to clarify the relationship between the chemical parameters measured and each of the ecotoxicity tests a optimized similarity analysis between Hasse diagrams for the ecotoxicity tests for different levels of monitoring and Hasse diagrams obtained by the use of the chemical parameters was performed. Finally, it could be concluded that for reliable monitoring of underground waters passing a dump collector following chemical parameters are of significance: water hardness, dissolved matter, total nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate nitrogen), nickel, chlorides, alkalinity, total organic carbon and ether extract and the proper battery test could include PGSA, PGSS and PRSS. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Questions: We investigated some commonly held assumptions of community assembly theory needed to provide accurate predictions of changes in plant species assemblages across environmental gradients or following environmental change. Do (1) dominant and subordinate species respond in the same way to changes in environmental variables; (2) plant species assemblages show higher interspecific than intraspecific trait responses; and (3) co-existing dominant species differ in their responses to the same environmental variables? Location: Islands in Lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan, northern Sweden. Methods: We explored the responses of forest understorey vegetation assemblages to variation in environmental resources across a chronosequence of 30 lake islands that differ in fire history, above-ground and below-ground resource availability and species diversity. For one plot on each island, we measured specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and foliar N and P of all dominant and subordinate understorey plant species to assess species-specific and weighted and non-weighted community-level trait responses to variation across islands in all major local environmental drivers. Results: Consistent with our expectations, we found that species responses to environmental conditions were not homogenous within assemblages, and that responses of dominant and subordinate species differed. Further, intraspecific variation was often an important component of local-scale plant community-level responses. Responses were often relatively consistent across species, but dominant species sometimes showed contrasting responses of the same trait to the same environmental factor. Finally, environmental factors that influenced community average trait values also affected functional diversity. Conclusions: This study has shown that several common assumptions that underpin community assembly theory do not necessarily hold, and this can cause inaccuracies in predicting plant functional composition responses to changes in environmental variables. Because these assumptions are central to current models that predict vegetation responses to environmental change, it is crucial to further test in which particular environmental context and to what extent these assumptions are critical for model accuracy.},

Network studies aiming to infer mechanisms from complex systems, however, usually focus on interactions between species, not individuals. Accordingly, the structure and underlying mechanisms of individual-based interaction networks remain largely unknown. In a common garden, we recorded all interactions on flowers and leaves of 97 Sinapis arvensis individuals from seedling stage to fruit set and related interindividual differences in interactions to the plant individuals' phenotypes. The plant individuals significantly differed in their quantitative and qualitative interactions with arthropods on flowers and leaves. These differences remained stable over the entire season and thus were time-invariant. Variation in interacting arthropod communities could be explained by a pronounced intraspecific variability in flowering phenology, morphology and flower scent, and translated into variation in reproductive success. Interestingly, plant individuals with a similar composition of flower visitors were also visited by a similar assemblage of interaction partners at leaves. Our results show that the nonuniformity of plant species has pronounced effects in community ecology, potentially with implications for the persistence of communities and populations, and their ability to withstand environmental fluctuations. \textcopyright{} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.},

We assessed the representativeness of biodiversity in existing protected areas in Japan using a distribution dataset and phylogenetic tree for 5565 Japanese vascular plant species. We first examined the overlap of species distribution with the existing protected areas and identified the minimum set representing all plant species. Second, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables in explaining the spatial arrangement of protected areas using a random forest model. Finally, we clarified how potential drivers of plant diversity were sufficiently captured within the protected areas network. Although the protected areas captured the majority of species, nearly half of the minimum set areas were selected from outside the existing protected areas. The locations of existing protected areas are mainly associated with geographical and socio-economic factors rather than key biodiversity features (including evolutionary distinctiveness). Moreover, critical biodiversity drivers, which include current climate, paleoclimatic stability, and geographical isolation, were biasedly emulated within the existing protected areas. These findings demonstrate that current conservation planning fails to represent the ecological and evolutionary processes relevant to species sorting, dispersal limitation, and allopatric speciation. In particular, under-representativeness of historically stable habitats that function as evolutionary hotspots or refugia in response to climate changes may pose a threat to the long-term persistence of Japan's endemic biota. This study provides a fundamental basis for developing prioritization measures to retain species assembly processes and in situ diversification along current climatic and geohistorical gradients.},

The eastern side of the central circular depression was dominated by fan-shaped Phakellia ventilabrum sponges and further characterized by Mycale lingua and Oceanapia spp. sponges. Phakellia ventilabrum abundance (0.34indm-2) was positively correlated with the number of drop stones found. The western side of the depression was dominated by Geodia barretti, G. macandrewii and G. atlantica with an estimated average abundance of 0.40indm-2 and a biomass of 2.4kgWWm-2. A third type of sponge community was found on both sides of the depression (in between the small scattered cold-water coral reefs constituting the MPA), which was characterized by Mycale lingua (0.20indm-2) and Oceanapia spp. (0.10indm-2), and which supported a high average Geodiidea biomass (1.6kgWWm-2). The two last communities were both of the boreal ostur type and seemed to form continuous belts along the 2km transects surveyed only interrupted by a few 15-30m long empty patches. Within the MPA the average overall biomass of Geodiidea sponges was 1.8kgWWm-2 and the overall sponge abundance was 1indm-2. Water pumping rates and respiration of Geodia barretti were measured, equating to 3000lkg-1 DW day-1 and 1.5??molO2g-1DWh-1, respectively. Up-scaling this to the MPA as a whole suggests that the population of G. barretti alone could filter approximately 250millionm3 of water and consume 60t of carbon daily. This demonstrates the important ecological function of sponges as nutrient vectors and points out the MPA as an ecologically significant area that should be carefully managed and monitored. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Standardised longline fishing was conducted twice, in June and March, and predetermined fishing effort was allocated to multiple plots with varying densities of small CWC mounds and sponges, plus control plots with neither of these habitats. Catches within all examined habitats were dominated by the commercially exploited Brosme brosme (representing \textquestiondown 70\% of the total catch) followed by Galeus melastomus, Chimaera monstrosa, Etmopterus spinax and the commercially exploited Molva molva. Positive correlations were found between catch rates of B. brosme, G. melastomus and C. monstrosa and the density of small CWC mounds at one or both sampling occasions. No correlations were found between the catch rates of the same three species and sponge density; thus the sponge-beds did not seem to represent an ecologically equivalent habitat to the CWCs. On a local scale the CWC habitat appeared to attract higher abundances of B. brosme, G. melastomus and C. monstrosa; however, the differences in catch rates between coral and non-coral areas were quite low (2-4 times) and for most species the fish-habitat relationships varied temporarily and with the spatial scale used to delineate the habitat. Based on the methods and the results of this study and the fact that CWCs only occupy a very small proportion of the Norwegian shelf, the importance of CWCs as habitat for the populations of the demersal fish species examined is judged as marginal. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, data on physiological and biological responses of the common demosponge Geodia barretti to short (4h) and long-term (50day) cyclic exposure of suspended particles are presented. The laboratory study showed that 4hour pulse exposures with crushed rock particles at 500mgl-1 caused a 50\% drop in oxygen consumption but with a quick recovery to pre-exposure oxygen consumption once suspended sediment loads returned to background levels. Long-term cyclic exposure (12h each 24h) for 29days caused a permanent drop in oxygen consumption with 60\% in sponges exposed to 50mgl-1 of crushed rock but with no apparent effect on the energy content of the sponge. Oxygen consumption and energy content of sponges exposed to natural bottom sediments at the same concentration remained unchanged. In conclusion, G. barretti appears to have well developed mechanisms to resist sediment stress, however, the study demonstrated that operations releasing large amounts of suspended crushed rock such as exploration drilling and submarine tailings disposal near sponge beds should be carefully planned to avoid long-term losses of benthic ecosystem functions, such as organic matter re-mineralization.},

However, the importance of ITV varies greatly among studies, and we lack a coherent understanding of the contexts under which to expect a high vs. low contribution of ITV to trait-environment matching among communities. Here we first elaborate a novel conceptual framework posing specific hypotheses and predictions about the environmental and ecological contexts underlying the contribution of ITV to community trait turnover. We then empirically test these predictions in understory herbaceous plant communities in a montane environment, for three functional traits (flowering phenology, specific leaf area, and height). We found that different components of trait variation mapped onto different environmental axes, specifically reporting a greater contribution of ITV along non-climatic axes (e.g., soil properties, light) than along the main climatic axis (i.e., elevation), as predicted by the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity (a major source of ITV) is greatest in response to conditions varying at a small spatial scale. Based on a variant of the niche-variation hypothesis, we predicted that the importance of ITV would be greatest in the lowest-diversity portion of the elevational gradient (i.e., at high elevation), but this prediction was not supported. Finally, the generally strong intraspecific responses to the gradient observed across species did not necessarily give rise to a high contribution of ITV (or vice versa) given (1) an especially weak or strong response of a dominant species driving the community-level trend, (2) differences among species in the direction of trait-environment response cancelling out, or (3) relatively narrow portions of the gradient where individual species abundances were high enough to have an important impact on community-level trait means. Our research identifies contexts in which we can predict that local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity will play a relatively large role in mediating community-level trait responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that intraspecific variation might have a potentially large role in driving functional community composition and response to environmental change. However, empirical evidence quantifying the respective importance of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation relative to species turnover is still lacking. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using a common herbaceous plant species (Oxalis montana) among low-, mid-, and high-elevation sites to first quantify the contributions of plasticity and genetic differentiation in driving intraspecific variation in three traits: height, specific leaf area, and leaf area. We next compared the contributions of these intraspecific drivers of community trait\textendash environment matching to that of species turnover, which had been previously assessed along the same elevational gradient. Plasticity was the dominant driver of intraspecific trait variation across elevation in all traits, with only a small contribution of genetic differentiation among populations. Local adaptation was not detected to a major extent along the gradient. Fitness components were greatest in O. montana plants with trait values closest to the local community-weighted means, thus supporting the common assumption that community-weighted mean trait values represent selective optima. Our results suggest that community-level trait responses to ongoing climate change should be mostly mediated by species turnover, even at the small spatial scale of our study, with an especially small contribution of evolutionary adaptation within species. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.

This control is critical for comparative studies, such as those often used to investigate intra-specific variation in properties of interest. By holding the environment constant, the experimentalist can gain insight into the genetic basis of phytoplankton phenotypes and by extension, into the adaptive history of those genotypes. In most cases the adaptations of interest are those that the algae have evolved in response to their natural environment. However, here it is argued that such experiments may instead reveal evolutionary adaptations to, and/or non-adaptive changes induced by, the culture conditions under which the alga is maintained. We present a review of the processes of evolution as they pertain to microalgal culture, and illustrate this discussion with examples of in-culture evolution from both within and outside the field of phycology. With these considerations in mind, recommendations are made for experimental practice focusing on comparative physiology, for which the effects of in-culture evolution are particularly confounding. Finally we argue that, although problematic in some contexts, the evolutionary propensities of phytoplankton cultures actually present an important opportunity for experimental evolutionary research with direct environmental significance. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this review, the principal methods developed so far for ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are reported and described given their distinct biology/ecology/evolutionary history. Factors that are the most important for their storage are presented and a protocol proposed which is applicable, although not generalizable, for the long-term preservation at ultra-low temperature of a large panel of these organisms. For ECM fungi, isolates should be grown on membranes or directly in cryovials until the late stationary growth phase. The recommended cryopreservation conditions are: a cryoprotectant of 10\% glycerol, applied 1-2 h prior to cryopreservation, a slow cooling rate (1 \textdegree C min(-1)) until storage below -130 \textdegree C, and fast thawing by direct plunging in a water bath at 35-37 \textdegree C. For AMF, propagules (i.e., spores/colonized root pieces) isolated from cultures in the late or stationary phase of growth should be used and incorporated in a carrier (i.e., soil or alginate beads), preferably dried, before cryopreservation. For in vitro-cultured isolates, 0.5 M trehalose should be used as cryoprotectant, while isolates produced in vivo can be preserved in dried soil without cryoprotectant. A fast cryopreservation cooling rate should be used (direct immersion in liquid nitrogen or freezing at temperatures below -130 \textdegree C), as well as fast thawing by direct immersion in a water bath at 35 \textdegree C.},

The goals and measures for the water bodies in the IJsselmeer area of The Netherlands are elaborated in this study, following an approach described by Irmer \& Pollard (2006, Alternative methodology for defin-ing Good Ecological Potential (GEP) for Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB) and Artificial Water Bodies (AWB). ECOSTAT). With the closure of the Afsluitdijk in 1932, the former Southern Sea estuary was transformed into the freshwater Lake IJsselmeer. Subsequently, a string of so-called border lakes and Lake Markermeer were created by land reclamation projects and the construction of dams. These alterations serve safety, provide drinking water supplies and created agricultural land. Owing to the change in category, the lakes are by (WFD) definition heavily modified. A natural lake rather than an estuary will be the starting point for determining ecological potential. However, damming and fixing the water table prevented the development of emer-gent vegetation and caused steep water-land gradients. The Maximum Ecological Potential includes the effect of these hydromorphological changes after all mitigation measures have been considered. Other pressures on the lakes are high nutrient loads, which cause phytoplankton blooms, the disappearance of aquatic macrophytes and inten-sive fishery, which overexploites the pikeperch and eel populations and causes indirect negative effects on water quality. Good Ecological Potential for these lakes is derived by estimating the effects of all effective hydromorphological measures that have no significant negative impact on existing functions or the wider environment, and the effects of all other measures. The suggested main measures are: con-struction of fish passages, adaptation of shore-lines, wind sheltered areas, reduction of nutrient load, reduction of fishery pressure and reduction of the bream stock. The effects of these measures are calculated from multivariate analyses that establish the relationships between (a) nutrients and chloro-phyll-a, (b) chlorophyll-a and water transparency, (c) water transparency, depth distribution and vegetation coverage and (d) vegetation coverage and fish community. The proposed goals will be refined using new scientific insights and further discussions with stakeholders, and will finally be reported in the River Basin Management Plan 2009. It is expected that exemptions will be used for a phased achievement of the objectives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In lakes with a deep-water algal maximum, herbivorous zooplankton are faced with a trade-off between high temperature but low food availability in the surface layers and low temperature but sufficient food in deep layers. It has been suggested that zooplankton (Daphnia) faced with this trade-off distribute vertically according to an "Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) with Costs". An experiment has been designed to test the density (competition) dependence of the vertical distribution as this is a basic assumption of IFD theory.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Experiments were performed in large, indoor mesocosms (Plankton Towers) with a temperature gradient of 10 degrees C and a deep-water algal maximum established below the thermocline. As expected, Daphnia aggregated at the interface between the two different habitats when their density was low. The distribution spread asymmetrically towards the algal maximum when the density increased until 80 \% of the population dwelled in the cool, food-rich layers at high densities. Small individuals stayed higher in the water column than large ones, which conformed with the model for unequal competitors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: The Daphnia distribution mimics the predictions of an IFD with costs model. This concept is useful for the analysis of zooplankton distributions under a large suite of environmental conditions shaping habitat suitability. Fish predation causing diel vertical migrations can be incorporated as additional costs. This is important as the vertical location of grazing zooplankton in a lake affects phytoplankton production and species composition, i.e. ecosystem function.},

A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age-specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age-class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.}

We examine evidence for TSD in 11 species by reviewing reports on five and presenting new data for six. The female-male pattern (FM; females at low temperature, males at high temperature) attributed to Alligator mississippiensis and Caiman crocodilus are here revised to be female-male-female (FMF; males at intermediate temperature, females at low and high temperatures). A similar pattern characterizes Crocodylus palustris, C. moreletii, C. siamensis, and Gavialis gangeticus based on new data; published accounts establish a FMF pattern in Crocodylus porosus, C. johnstoni, and C. niloticus. TSD apparently occurs in Paleosuchus trigonatus and Alligator sinensis, but patterns are not yet documented. In the well-studied species, the incubation temperatures for FM transitions are congruent, but MF transition temperatures differ among species. In A. mississippiensis, 100\% males are produced over a range of constant incubation temperatures, whereas in C. johnstoni, only low proportions of males are produced at any constant temperature. The thermosensitive period (TSP) for A. mississippiensis occurs during stages 21 to 24 (days 30\textendash 45 at intermediate temperatures) and coincides with gonadal differentiation. A similar scenario is suggested in other species. The TSP in A. mississippiensis (and possibly other crocodilians) encompasses the third quarter of development and occurs later than in turtles and a lizard. In A. mississippiensis as in turtles, the duration (cumulative effect) and/or the magnitude (potency effect) of incubation temperatures during the TSP predictably alter sex ratios. TSP chronologies and features which are shared among TSD reptiles suggest common, underlying mechanisms; A. mississippiensis is an appropriate model for further study. In crocodilians, clutch effects are a significant source of variation in TSD response. Hatchling sex ratios previously reported for A. mississippiensis are reconsidered in light of our new data. \textcopyright{} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Both relationships were independent of temperature and daylength. Species best adapted to growth at low light were found to exhibit high Chl a:C ratios and low maintenance respiration rates. As a group, diatoms were consistently the best adapted for growth at low irradiance. Chiorophytes, haptophytes, chrysophytes and cryptophytes were intermediate in their performance at low irradiance. Dinoflagellates exhibited extreme diversity, with species spanning the spectrum from very good performance at low irradiance to very poor. A new {$\mu$}max-cell carbon relationship is given based on growth rates normalized to 15\textdegree C. Evidence is presented to show that noise in this relationship can be significantly reduced by using only carbon-specific growth rates and using only data for species grown at the same daylength. \textcopyright{} 1988 IRL Press Limited.},

Previous studies of multiple-stressor effects on freshwater fish suggest a prevalence of antagonistic interactions. However, taxonomy, life stage and/or environmental context likely modify the magnitude and direction of fish responses to multiple stressors. Stressor intensity, impact mechanism, exposure time and ecosystem size may further affect interaction outcomes. Large-scale studies quantifying how these variables moderate stressor interactions are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a meta-analysis of 29 factorial multiple-stressor experiments to examine the influence of seven potential moderator variables on the magnitude and direction of stressor interactions. Using weighted random-effects meta-analytic models, we demonstrate the importance of taxonomic identity and life stage for interaction outcomes. In particular, Cypriniformes showed stronger antagonisms than Salmoniformes, as did larval fish compared to juveniles. Interaction outcomes also varied among the measured fish responses with survival yielding stronger antagonisms than biomass. Increasing experimental duration and volume of the experimental units both drove interactions towards synergisms, supporting findings from previous studies that synergisms take time and space to develop. In an era when the number of stressors affecting freshwater systems is increasing rapidly, our study provides a vital step towards identifying generalities in multiple-stressor outcomes and thus improved predictions of multiple-stressor impacts. Furthermore, our meta-analysis complements studies in real streams, rivers and lakes by providing an experimentally derived context for the growing number of multiple-stressor assessments in research, management and conservation of freshwater fish.},

For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.},

Viral abundance showed significant differences between oceans in the epipelagic and mesopelagic, but not in the bathypelagic, and decreased with depth, with an average power-law scaling exponent of -1.03 km-1 from an average of 7.76 \texttimes{} 106 viruses ml-1 in the epipelagic to 0.62 \texttimes{} 106 viruses ml-1 in the bathypelagic layer with an average integrated (0 to 4000 m) viral stock of about 0.004 to 0.044 g C m-2, half of which is found below 775 m. Lysogenic viral production was higher than lytic viral production in surface waters, whereas the opposite was found in the bathypelagic, where prokaryotic mortality due to viruses was estimated to be 60 times higher than grazing. Free viruses had turnover times of 0.1 days in the bathypelagic, revealing that viruses in the bathypelagic are highly dynamic. On the basis of the rates of lysed prokaryotic cells, we estimated that viruses release 145 Gt C year-1 in the global tropical and subtropical oceans.

Few studies have considered the change in phenotypic flexibility among geographic populations in marine calcifiers to ocean acidification projections, despite the fact that this type of study provides understanding about how the organism may respond to this chemical change in the ocean. We examined the geographic variation in CO2 seawater concentrations in the phenotype and in the reaction norm of physiological traits using a laboratory mesocosm approach with short-term acclimation in two contrasting populations (Antofagasta and Calfuco) of the intertidal snail Concholepas concholepas. Our results show that elevated pCO2 conditions increase standard metabolic rates in both populations of the snail juveniles, likely due to the higher energy cost of homeostasis. Juveniles of C. concholepas in the Calfuco (southern) population showed a lower increment of metabolic rate in high-pCO2 environments concordant with a lesser gene expression of a heat shock protein with respect to the Antofagasta (northern) population. Combined these results indicate a negative effect of ocean acidification on whole-organism functioning of C. concholepas. Finally, the significant Population??pCO2 level interaction in both studied traits indicates that there is variation between populations in response to high-pCO2 conditions. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Food supply to reef sites varies considerably both spatially and temporarily. In this study we investigated the effects of starvation and zooplankton feeding on respiration and growth of L. pertusa. In our first experiment, corals were starved for 6 mo, resulting in a 40\% decrease in respiration but no visible effects on coral condition or survival. In a second experiment, corals were fed nauplii of Artemia salina for 15 wk at 4 different densities; the organic carbon provided corresponded to between 20 and 300\% of the carbon turned over by initial respiration. Respiration rate increased with zooplankton food density, but no effect on skeletal growth could be detected. Skeletal growth remained positive even at low food density. Compared to initial conditions, there was a general decrease in the total concentrations of both structural and storage fatty acids independent of food treatment, but no significant effect among the treatments was discovered. The amount of organic carbon and nitrogen also decreased during the experiment, although significantly less in the highest food density compared to the lowest. The results indicate that L. pertusa is highly tolerant to living on minimal resources for periods of several months. Response-times to varying food conditions were slow, but results suggest that tissue content and composition is a better indicator of food conditions in L. pertusa compared to calcification rates.},

Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 \textdegree C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models. \textcopyright{} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, testing relationships between traits and vital rates to infer effects on fitness can be misleading. Demographic trade-offs can generate variation in vital rates that yield equal population growth rates, thereby obscuring the net effect of traits on fitness. To address this problem, we describe a diversity of approaches to quantify intrinsic growth rates of plant populations, including experiments beyond range boundaries, density-dependent population models built from long-term demographic data, theoretical models, and methods that leverage widely available monitoring data. Linking plant traits directly to intrinsic growth rates is a fundamental step toward rigorous predictions of population dynamics and community assembly.},

  abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

Difference among species' responses to environmental fluctuations provides a general mechanism for the hypothesis. Previous experimental investigations of the insurance hypothesis have not examined this mechanism directly. 2. First, responses to temperature of four protist species were measured in laboratory microcosms. For each species, we measured the response of intrinsic rate of increase (r) and carrying capacity (K) to temperature. 3. Next, communities containing pairs of species were exposed to temperature fluctuations. Community biomass varied less when correlation in K between species (but not r) was more negative, and this resulted from more negative covariances in population sizes, as predicted. Results were contingent on species identity, with findings differing between analyses including or not including communities containing one particular species. 4. These findings provide the clearest support to date for this mechanism of the insurance hypothesis. Biodiversity, in terms of differences in species' responses to environmental fluctuations (i.e. functional response diversity) stabilizes community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Considering both within- and between-species functional diversities in plant communities has been recently suggested as a way to understand potential assembly mechanisms that control species coexistence. In particular, relating variations in species richness to within- and between-species functional diversities can provide a useful framework for evaluating the importance of alternative community assembly theories. In addition, little is known about whether the relationship between species richness and functional diversity components arises from direct or indirect effects of the abiotic environment. We tested the relationship between functional diversity and species richness by disentangling functional diversity components into within-species, between-species and total functional diversities and by considering potential direct and indirect effects of the abiotic conditions. Multi- and single-trait approaches were applied using three key plant functional traits (height, specific leaf area (SLA), LDMC). Traits were measured on species coexisting across sixteen species-rich limestone grasslands. Direct and indirect effects of the abiotic conditions were evaluated using multiple soil properties including heterogeneity in soil depths. The within-species functional diversity ranged between 13.5\% and 33.6\% of the total functional diversity. Within-species diversity was the main functional component linked to variations in species richness, despite the within-species functional diversity being lower than between-species functional diversity. Environmental soil properties had a direct effect on species richness but did not affect functional diversity components. Synthesis: Our results provide evidence that increasing the trait overlap between species, due to an increase in within-species diversity, may relate to greater species coexistence. Disentangling multiple functional diversity components indicated that there may be equalizing mechanisms that act as potential drivers of species coexistence. In addition, it suggests the possibility that this approach may provide a better understanding of the processes involved in the structure of plant communities.

Three key functional traits [plant height, leaf area (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA)] were assessed to quantify the range of ITV of four dominant plant species along a rainfall gradient in semi-arid Mediterranean shrublands. Variance partitioning and confirmatory multilevel path analyses were used to assess the direct and indirect effects of rainfall, space limitation (crowding) and neighbouring plant traits on ITV. The direct effect of the local neighbourhood on the trait values of subordinate individuals was as strong as the effect of rainfall. The indirect effect of rainfall, however, mediated by the effect of the local neighbourhood on the trait values of subordinate individuals, was weak. Rainfall decreased the height and SLA of subordinate individuals, but increased their LA. Neighbouring plant traits were just as strong predictors as crowding in explaining changes in ITV. Synthesis. Our study provides a framework to disentangle the direct effects of abiotic factors and their indirect effects on ITV mediated by the local neighbourhood. Our results highlight that abiotic and biotic constraints are both substantial sources of trait variations at the individual level, and can blur processes underlying changes in ITV. Considering and disentangling combined sources with an individual perspective would help to refine our predictions for community assembly and functional ecology.},

  abstract = {Dispersal of fluvial freshwater fish larvae occurs commonly in heavily regulated rivers. Studies increasingly indicate that drifting young fish have an active component to their movement and so are capable of coping with the dynamic hydraulic forces typical of rivers. We investigated hydraulic-drift relationships of the young stages of fish over one breeding season along a gravel shore of the Austrian Danube using stationary drift nets from the first occurrence until the end of the seasonal peak (April-June 2008). Observed densities of families and developmental stages were related to the hydraulic parameters flow velocity (in three spatial directions), turbulent kinetic energy and water depth, derived from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the sampling site. We detected distinct responses of drifting young fish to several hydro-physical factors under conditions (low light level, over-critical currents), which were considered to cause washouts and passive drift. In general, drift densities decreased with water depth and flow velocity. Weak swimmers (e.g. bull head Cottus gobio and early-stage cyprinid larvae) avoided turbulent flows, as their abilities to orientate and hold position may be limited. Early larval as well as early juvenile stages of cyprinids used lateral currents directing to the bank, potentially to drop out of the flow and reach inshore areas. Our study indicates that there are family-specific and stage-specific responses to hydraulic variables and that fish actively disperse, probably to minimize mortality and maximize successful dispersal.

In the present study, we examined how elevated CO2 affects various intertidal epibenthic (benthic copepod), intertidal endobenthic (Manila clam and Venus clam), sub-tidal benthic (brittle starfish), and free-living (marine medaka) organisms in areas expected to be impacted by leakage. Acute lethal and sub-lethal effects were detected in the adult stage of all test organisms exposed to varying concentrations of CO2, due to the associated decline in pH (8.3 to 5.2) during 96-h exposure. However, intertidal organisms (such as benthic copepods and clams) showed remarkable resistance to elevated CO2, with the Venus clam being the most tolerant (LpH50 = 5.45). Sub-tidal species (such as brittle starfish [LpH50 = 6.16] and marine medaka [LpH50 = 5.91]) were more sensitive to elevated CO2 compared to intertidal species, possibly because they have fewer defensive capabilities. Of note, the exposure duration might regulate the degree of acute sub-lethal effects, as evidenced by the Venus clam, which showed a time-dependent effect to elevated CO2. Finally, copper was chosen as a model toxic element to find out the synergistic or antagonistic effects between ocean acidification and metal pollution. Combination of CO2 and Cu exposure enhances the adverse effects to organisms, generally supporting a synergistic effect scenario. Overall, the significant variation in the degree to which CO2 adversely affected organisms (viz., working range and strength) was clearly observed, supporting the general concept of species-dependent effects of elevated CO2.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Beta diversity is a key concept for understand- ing the functioning of ecosystems; for the conservation of biodiversity and for ecosystem management. The present report describes how to analyse beta diversity from community composition and associated environmental and spatial data tables.; Methods Beta diversity can be studied by computing diversity indices for each site and testing hypotheses about the factors that may explain the var- iation among sites. Alternatively; one can carry out a direct analysis of the community composition data table over the study sites; as a function of sets of environmental and spatial variables. These anal- yses are carried out by the statistical method of partitioning the var- iation of the diversity indices or the community composition data table with respect to environmental and spatial variables. Variation partitioning is briefly described herein.; Important findings Variation partitioning is a method of choice for the interpretation of beta diversity using tables ofenvironmentalandspatialvariables. Beta diversity is an interesting `currency' for ecologists to compare either different sampling areas or different ecological communities co- occurring in an area. Partitioning must be based upon unbiased esti- mates of the variation of the community composition data table that is explained by the various tables of explanatory variables. The adjusted coefficient of determination provides such an unbiased estimate in both multiple regression and canonical redundancy analysis. After partitioning; one can test the significance of the fractions of interest and plot maps of the fitted values corresponding to these fractions},

A main vector is ballast water exchange from shipping. This study evaluates the use of ecological niche modelling (ENM) to predict the spread of 18 non-indigenous species (NIS) along shipping routes and their potential habitat suitability (hot/cold spots) in the Baltic Sea and Northeast Atlantic. Results show that, contrary to current risk assessment methods, temperature and sea ice concentration determine habitat suitability for 61\% of species, rather than salinity (11\%). We show high habitat suitability for NIS in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, a transitional area for NIS entering or leaving the Baltic Sea. As many cases of NIS introduction in the marine environment are associated with shipping pathways, we explore how ENM can be used to provide valuable information on the potential spread of NIS for ballast water risk assessment.},

  abstract = {The reaction of species to changing conditions determines how community composition will change functionally \textemdash{} not only by (temporal) species turnover, but also by trait shifts within species. For the latter, selection from standing variation has been suggested to be more efficient than acquiring new mutations. Yet, studies on community trait composition and trait selection largely focus on phenotypic variation in ecological traits, whereas the underlying genomic traits remain relatively understudied despite evidence of their role to standing variation. Using a genome-explicit, niche- and individual-based model, we address the potential interactions between genomic and ecological traits shaping communities under an environmental selective forcing, namely temporal variation. In this model, all ecological traits are explicitly coded by the genome. For our experiments, we initialized 90 replicate communities, each with ca. 350 initial species, characterized by random genomic and ecological trait combinations, on a 2D spatially-explicit landscape with two orthogonal gradients (temperature and resource use). We exposed each community to two contrasting scenarios: without (i.e. static environments) and with temporal variation. We then analyzed emerging compositions of both genomic and ecological traits at the community, population and genomic levels. Communities in variable environments were species poorer than in static environments, populations more abundant and genomes had a higher numbers of genes. The surviving genomes (i.e. those selected by variable environments) coded for enhanced environmental tolerance and smaller biomass, which resulted in faster life cycles and thus also in increased potential for evolutionary rescue. Even under the constant environmental filtering presented by temporal environmental variation, larger, more linked genomes allowed selection of increased variation in dispersal abilities. Our results provide clues to how sexually-reproducing diploid plant communities might react to increased environmental variation and highlights the importance of genomic traits and their interaction with ecological traits for eco-evolutionary responses to changing climates.},

  abstract = {Top-down grazer control of cyanobacteria is a controversial topic due to conflicting reports of success and failure as well as a bias towards studies in temperate climates with large generalist grazers like Daphnia. In the tropical lowland lakes of Brazil, calanoid copepods of the Notodiaptomus complex dominate zooplankton and co-exist in high abundance with permanent blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, raising questions for grazer effects on bloom dynamics (i.e., top-down control vs. facilitation of cyanobacterial dominance). Accordingly, the effect of copepod grazing on the relative abundance of Microcystis co-cultured with a eukaryotic phytoplankton (Cryptomonas) was evaluated in a series of six-day laboratory experiments. Grazer effects were tested in incubations where the growth of each phytoplankton in the presence or absence of the copepod N. iheringi was monitored in 1L co-cultures, starting with a 6-fold initial dominance of Cryptomonas by biomass. Compared to the no grazer controls, N. iheringi reduced the growth of both phytoplankton, but Cryptomonas growth was reduced to negative values while Microcystis growth continued positively despite grazers. Hence, in a matter of six days selective grazing by N. iheringi increased the biomass of Microcystis relative to Cryptomonas by an order of magnitude compared to controls, and thus, facilitated the dominance of this cyanobacterium. To account for the potential effect of allelopathy, we performed a secondary experiment comparing the abundance and growth rate of Microcystis and Cryptomonas in single and mixed co-cultures in the absence of grazers. The growth rate of Microcystis was unaffected by the presence or relative abundance of Cryptomonas, and vice versa, indicating no allelopathic effects. Our results suggest that selectively grazing zooplankton may facilitate cyanobacteria blooms by grazing on their eukaryotic phytoplankton competitors in nature. Given that selective grazers predominate zooplankton biomass in warmer waters, grazer facilitation of blooms may be a common but poorly understood regulator of plankton dynamics in a warmer and more eutrophic world.},

However, little is known about the variation of functional traits within populations and about differences in this variation on larger spatial scales. In a first approach, we therefore related trait expression to climate and local environmental conditions, studying two temperate forest herbs, Milium effusum and Stachys sylvatica, along a {$\sim$}1800\textendash 2500 km latitudinal gradient. Within each of 9\textendash 10 regions in six European countries, we collected data from six populations of each species and recorded several variables in each region (temperature, precipitation) and population (light availability, soil parameters). For each plant, we measured height, leaf area, specific leaf area, seed mass and the number of seeds and examined environmental effects on within-population trait variation as well as on trait means. Most importantly, trait variation differed both between and within populations. Species, however, differed in their response. Intrapopulation variation in Milium was consistently positively affected by higher mean temperatures and precipitation as well as by more fertile local soil conditions, suggesting that more productive conditions may select for larger phenotypic variation. In Stachys, particularly light availability positively influenced trait variation, whereas local soil conditions had no consistent effects. Generally, our study emphasises that intra-population variation may differ considerably across larger scales\textemdash due to phenotypic plasticity and/or underlying genetic diversity\textemdash possibly affecting species response to global environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Alternative pathways such as environmentally induced genetic modifications and non-genetic heritable phenotypes have been proposed mechanisms for heritable adaptation within an ecologically relevant time frame. However, experimental evidence is currently lacking to establish if, and to what extent, these sources of phenotypic variation can produce a response. To test if adaptation can rapidly occur in the absence of initial standing genetic variation and recombination in small populations, we (a) exposed replicate monoclonal populations of the microzooplankton Brachionus calyciflorus to a culturing regime that selected for phenotypic variants with elevated population growth with either high or low phosphorus food for a period of 55 days and (b) examined population level response in two fully factorial common garden experiments at day 15 and 35 of the exposure experiment. Within six generations, we observed heritable local adaptation to nutrient limitation. More specifically, populations with a history of exposure to low P food exhibited higher population growth rates under low P food conditions than populations with a high P exposure history. However, the capacity for such a response was found to vary among clones. Our study finds that although standing genetic variation is considered essential for rapid heritable adaptation, the rapid emergence of de novo genetic variation or alternative sources of phenotypic variation could aid in the establishment and persistence of low-diversity populations.

In the context of maintenance of biodiversity and ecological functions, microbial ecologists face the challenge of linking individual level variability in functional traits to larger scale ecosystem p rocesses. Phytoplankton cell size and shape are key traits under selection by environmental filters and species interactions. Spatial differences in resource availability shape species diversity according to their use efficiency. Niche partitioning promotes plankton diversity. Here, we explore how size and shape enter the diversity game. How does taxonomic and morpho-functional community structure vary at different spatial scales? What are the potential drivers shaping the structure of phytoplankton communities? We explore these questions by looking at the individual level variability in taxonomic and morphological traits in a biogeographical snapshot of natural phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems around the globe. We found that taxonomic variability is mainly concentrated at local and regional levels, whereas shape and size variability are mainly concentrated at a local level, despite the environmental heterogeneity of ecosystems. Species diversity was more variable than trait diversity from local to global spatial scales. We suggest that structural organization of phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems may follow a hierarchical pattern of trait organization, where a different combination of multiple functional traits may represent effective strategies and promote success under given environmental conditions as a resolution of Hutchinson's paradox.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities and their response to environmental gradients are increasingly being described by various measures of trait composition. Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species, weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits, trait averages can be calculated from 'fixed' trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot, or habitat, where the species is found. Changes in fixed averages across environments reflect species turnover, while changes in specific traits reflect both species turnover and within-species variability in traits. Here we suggest a practical method (accompanied by a set of R functions) that, by combining 'fixed' and 'specific averages', disentangles the effect of species turnover, intraspecific trait variability, and their covariation. These effects can be further decomposed into parts ascribed to individual explanatory variables (i.e. treatments or environmental gradients considered). The method is illustrated with a case study from a factorial mowing and fertilization experiment in a meadow in South Bohemia. Results show that the variability decomposition differs markedly among traits studied (height, Specific Leaf Area, Leaf N, P, C concentrations, leaf and stem dry matter content), both according to the relative importance of species turnover and intraspecific variability, and also according to their response to experimental factors. Both the effect of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover must be taken into account when assessing the functional role of community trait structure. Neglecting intraspecific trait variability across habitats often results in underestimating the response of communities to environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.}

While the roles of bottom-up processes are better appreciated they are still viewed as principally affecting the outcome of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important members of the benthic community and provide a critically important functional linkage between water-column productivity and the benthos. As active suspension feeders sponges utilize the abundant autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in the water column. As a result sponges across the Caribbean basin exhibit a consistent and significant pattern of greater biomass, tube extension rate, and species numbers with increasing depth. Likewise, the abundance of their food supply also increases along a depth gradient. Using experimental manipulations it has recently been reported that predation is the primary determinant of sponge community structure. Here we provide data showing that the size and growth of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis are significantly affected by food availability. Sponges increased in size and tube extension rate with increasing depth down to 46 m, while simultaneously exposed to the full range of potential spongivores at all depths. Additionally, we point out important flaws in the experimental design used to demonstrate the role of predation and suggest that a resolution of this important question will require well-controlled, multi-factorial experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of predation and food abundance on the ecology of sponges.},

In the Gulf of Maine (GOM), the rocky intertidal harbors the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, an important ecosystem engineer in these communities. Using mussel collections in the Southwest GOM from different tidal heights and a common garden experiment, mussels show significant, phenotypically plastic, effects of tidal height in multiple parameters related to metabolic capacity and stress tolerance. When these mussels are then experimentally exposed to the independent and interactive effects of thermal stress and ocean acidification, several biomarkers of stress (e.g., oxidative stress, HSP70, protein synthesis) are elevated in treatments with higher temperatures, but when combined with lower pH consistent with future predictions these markers show evidence of metabolic depression. In marine ecosystems, exposure to ocean acidification has been hypothesized as a factor that would narrow the thermal window of physiological tolerance for many invertebrates such as marine mussels.

Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer\textendash resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

However, much of this work examines the coexistence of just pairs of competitors. This approach ignores those mechanisms of coexistence that emerge only in diverse competitive networks. Despite the potential for these mechanisms to create conditions under which the loss of one competitor triggers the loss of others, we lack the knowledge needed to judge their importance for coexistence in nature. Progress requires borrowing insight from the study of multitrophic interaction networks, and coupling empirical data to models of competition.},

In the past 3 decades, a number of new models have been proposed, yet researchers still find it difficult to select appropriate models for data and objectives. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the prevailing species distribution models for newcomers in the field of modelling. We compared 11 popular models, including regression models (the generalized linear model, the generalized additive model, the multivariate adaptive regression splines model and hierarchical modelling), classification models (mixture discriminant analysis, the generalized boosting model, and classification and regression tree analysis) and complex models (artificial neural network, random forest, genetic algorithm for rule set production and maximum entropy approaches). Our objectives are: (i) to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models, their characteristics and identify suitable situations for their use (in terms of data type and species-environment relationships) and (ii) to provide guidelines for model application, including 3 steps: model selection, model formulation and parameter estimation. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd, ISZS and IOZ/CAS.},

In coastal waters, however, both temperatures and pCO2 (pH) exhibit diel variations, and biological performances are likely to be modulated by physical and chemical environmental changes. To understand how coastal zooplankton respond to the combined impacts of heat shock and increased pCO2, the benthic copepod Tigriopus japonicus were treated at temperatures of 24, 28, 32 and 36 \textdegree C to simulate natural coastal temperatures experienced in warming events, when acclimated in the short term to either ambient (LC, 390 {$\mu$}atm) or future CO2 (HC, 1000 {$\mu$}atm). HC and heat shock did not induce any mortality of T. japonicus, though respiration increased up to 32 \textdegree C before being depressed at 36 \textdegree C. Feeding rate peaked at 28 \textdegree C but did not differ between CO2 treatments. Expression of heat shock proteins (hsps mRNA) was positively related to temperature, with no significant differences between the CO2 concentrations. Nauplii production was not affected across all treatments. Our results demonstrate that T. japonicus responds more sensitively to heat shocks rather than to seawater acidification; however, ocean acidification may synergistically act with ocean warming to mediate the energy allocation of copepods.},

Assessing the accuracy of predictive models is critical because predictive models have been increasingly used across various disciplines and predictive accuracy determines the quality of resultant predictions. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) are among the most widely used measures for assessing predictive models for numerical data, although they are argued to be biased, insufficient and misleading. In this study, geometrical graphs were used to illustrate what were used in the calculation of r and r 2 and simulations were used to demonstrate the behaviour of r and r 2 and to compare three accuracy measures under various scenarios. Relevant confusions about r and r 2 , has been clarified. The calculation of r and r 2 is not based on the differences between the predicted and observed values. The existing error measures suffer various limitations and are unable to tell the accuracy. Variance explained by predictive models based on cross-validation (VEcv) is free of these limitations and is a reliable accuracy measure. Legates and McCabe's efficiency (E 1 ) is also an alternative accuracy measure. The r and r 2 do not measure the accuracy and are incorrect accuracy measures. The existing error measures suffer limitations. VEcv and E 1 are recommended for assessing the accuracy. The applications of these accuracy measures would encourage accuracy-improved predictive models to be developed to generate predictions for evidence-informed decision-making.},

However, it is still unclear how the variability differs across three nested spatial scales (individual, plot, and site) and which determinants (climatic, soil, and ontogenetic variables) shape the trait variability. Along a latitudinal gradient in Korean pine broadleaved forest of northeast China, we quantified the extent of intraspecific variability of four functional traits in two dominant trees Pinus koraiensis and Fraxinus mandshurica at eight sites, including specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (morphological traits) and leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content (physiological traits). Results showed a large trait variation within and between species (coefficient variation: 6.07\textendash 23.3\%). The leaf physiological traits of F. mandshurica and morphological traits of P. koraiensis were more responsive at site scale, while the morphological traits of F. mandshurica and physiological traits of P. koraiensis were more responsive at individual scale. In addition, abiotic and biotic factors explaining functional trait variation differ markedly between the two tree species, with physiological trait of F. mandshurica being more associated with climate and soil, while traits variability in P. koraiensis was not affected by climate, soil, and ontogeny, except for leaf phosphorus content. Overall, we can predict that the physiological traits of broadleaved species tend to be more sensitive to environmental changes, while pines are more sensitive to competition. It is critical to determine which spatial scale and trait type should be taken into account in predictive models of vegetation dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

Here we report on intraspecific variation of hydraulic traits in Banksia serrata (L.f.) sampled from three sites characterised by contrasting climates (warm-wet, warm-dry and cool-wet). Hydraulic characteristics including vulnerability to embolism, hydraulic conductance, pressure-volume traits and key morphological traits were measured. Vulnerability to embolism in leaf and stem, defined by the water potential inducing 50 and 88\% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P 50 and P 88 respectively), did not differ across sites. However, plants from the warm-dry environment exhibited higher stem conductivity (K s ) than the cool-wet environment. Leaf turgor loss point (TLP) did not vary among sites, but warm-dry site plants showed lower leaf capacitance (C{${_\ast}$} FT ) and higher modulus of elasticity ({$\epsilon$}) than the other two sites. Plants from the cool-wet site had lower specific leaf area (SLA) and plants from the warm-dry site had lower sapwood density (WD). Overall, key hydraulic traits were generally conserved across populations despite differences in mean site water availability, and the safety-efficiency trade-off was absent in this species. These results suggest that B. serrata has limited ability to adjust hydraulic architecture in response to environmental change and thus may be susceptible to climate change-type drought stress. \textcopyright{} 2019 CSIRO.},

In northern Europe it is known that one particularly large (up to 30 kg wet weight) bloom forming jellyfish is Rhizostoma spp. Given the potential importance, we set out to review all known records from peer-reviewed and broader public literature of the jellyfish R. octopus (Linnaeus) and R. pulmo (Macri) (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomae) across western Europe. These data revealed distinct hotspots where regular Rhizostoma spp. aggregations appeared to form, with other sites characterized by occasional abundances and a widespread distribution of infrequent observations. Surveys of known R. octopus hotspots around the Irish Sea also revealedmarked inter-annual variation with particularly high abundances forming during 2003. The location of such consistent aggregations and inter-annual variances are discussed in relation to physical, climatic and dietary variations.},

As the invasion intensifies and expands, there is an urgent need to identify species that are most at risk for extirpation\textemdash and possible extinction\textemdash from this added threat. To address this gap and inform conservation plans, we develop and apply a quantitative framework for classifying the relative vulnerability of fishes based on morphological and behavioural traits known to influence susceptibility to lionfish predation (e.g. body shape, water column position and aggregation behaviour), habitat overlap with lionfish, and degree of geographic range restriction. Applying the framework to fishes across the invaded Caribbean Sea and ahead of the invasion front in the southwestern Atlantic revealed the identity of at least 77 fishes with relatively small ranges that are likely to be most affected by lionfish predation. Trait-based vulnerability scores significantly predict the probability of fishes appearing within the diets of lionfish across the invaded region. Spatial richness analyses reveal hotspots of vulnerable species in the Bahamas, Belize and Cura\c{c}ao. Crucially, our framework identifies 29 vulnerable fishes endemic to Brazil, which has not yet been colonized by lionfish. Of these, we suggest reefs around offshore island groups occupied by a dozen highly vulnerable and range-restricted species as priorities for intervention should lionfish spread to the region. Observations of the rate of lionfish spread across the invaded range suggest that an average of 5 years (with a median of nearly 2 years) elapses from first sighting to maximum observed densities. This lag may allow managers to mobilize plans to suppress lionfish ahead of an invasion front in priority locations. Our framework also provides a method for assessing the relative vulnerability of cryptobenthic and/or deep-reef fishes, for which population-monitoring data are limited.},

The goal of this study was to develop a protocol for single cell live sorting of freshwater ciliates which can be applied in future laboratory experiments. Unstained and DAPI-stained specimens of four species of common prostomatid freshwater ciliates were sorted and their survival and growth were then monitored in micro-well plates. Three out of four species investigated (Urotricha farcta, Urotricha castalia, and Coleps spetai) grew after sorting. For the two Urotricha species up to 92-100\% of the sorted cells grew after sorting, depending on DAPI-concentration. For C spetai up to 25\% grew. The smallest and most delicate species, Balanion planctonicum, was difficult to sort unstained and appeared not to grow after single cell sorting. DAPI-staining at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 mug DAPI ml(-1) improved flow cytometric discrimination between the ciliates and non-target particles in the samples. The impact of DAPI-staining on the growth of the sorted cells differed between species. However, three of the four species tested grew reasonably well after staining with 0.1 mug DAPI ml(-1). We expect that this staining and sorting protocol may greatly facilitate and improve future experiments with cultured ciliates.},

Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

Two main theoretical frameworks are used to address this question, adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics, both of which have strengths and limitations and are often used by distinct research communities to address different questions. In order to make progress, new theoretical developments are needed that integrate these approaches and strengthen the link to empirical data. Here, we discuss a novel theoretical framework that bridges the gap between quantitative genetics and adaptive dynamics approaches. `Oligomorphic dynamics' can be used to analyse eco-evolutionary dynamics across different time scales and extends quantitative genetics theory to account for multimodal trait distributions, the dynamical nature of genetic variance, the potential for disruptive selection due to ecological feedbacks, and the non-normal or skewed trait distributions encountered in nature. Oligomorphic dynamics explicitly takes into account the effect of environmental feedback, such as frequency- and density-dependent selection, on the dynamics of multi-modal trait distributions and we argue it has the potential to facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data.},

Trait-based approaches are being increasingly used in ecology to do just that: explain and predict species distributions along environmental gradients. These approaches can be successful in understanding the diversity and community structure of phytoplankton. Among major traits shaping phytoplankton distributions are resource utilization traits, morphological traits (with size being probably the most influential), grazer resistance traits, and temperature responses. We review these trait-based approaches and give examples of how trait data can explain species distributions in both freshwater and marine systems. We also outline new directions in trait-based approaches applied to phytoplankton such as looking simultaneously at trait and phylogenetic structure of phytoplankton communities and using adaptive dynamics models to predict trait evolution. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton are major primary consumers and predators in most aquatic ecosystems. They exhibit tremendous diversity of traits, ecological strategies and, consequently, impacts on other trophic levels and the cycling of materials and energy. An adequate representation of this diversity in community and ecosystem models is necessary to generate realistic predictions on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but remains extremely challenging. We propose that the use of trait-based approaches is a promising way to reduce complexity while retaining realism in developing novel descriptions of zooplankton in ecosystem models. Characterizing zooplankton traits and trade-offs will also be helpful in understanding the selection pressures and diversity patterns that emerge in different ecosystems along major environmental gradients. Zooplankton traits can be characterized according to their function and type. Some traits, such as body size and motility, transcend several functions and are major determinants of zooplankton ecological strategies. Future developments of trait-based approaches to zooplankton should assemble a comprehensive matrix of key traits for diverse groups and explore it for general patterns; develop novel predictive models that explicitly incorporate traits and associated trade-offs; and utilize these traits to explain and predict zooplankton community structure and dynamics under different environmental conditions, including global change scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author.},

  abstract = {Aim Species distribution models have been widely used to tackle ecological, evolutionary and conservation problems. Most species distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be used confidently with presence-only data. Location We used real spatially explicit environmental data derived from the western part of the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, and simulated species distributions within this area. Methods Thirteen existing threshold selection methods were investigated mathematically to see whether the same threshold can be produced using either presence/absence data or presence-only data. We further adopted a simulation approach, created many virtual species with differing prevalences in a real landscape in south-eastern Australia, generated data sets with different proportions of pseudo-absences, built eight types of models with four modelling techniques, and investigated the behaviours of four threshold selection methods in these situations. Results Three threshold selection methods were not affected by pseudo-absences, including max SSS (which is based on maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity), the prevalence of model training data and the mean predicted value of a set of random points. Max SSS produced higher sensitivity in most cases and higher true skill statistic and kappa in many cases than the other methods. The other methods produced different thresholds from presence-only data to those determined from presence/absence data. Main conclusions Max SSS is a promising method for threshold selection when only presence data are available},

Synechococcus containing only PC (PC-rich Synechococcus) dominated at the estuarine station in summer, whereas PE-rich marine Synechococcus containing both PC and PE (PE-rich Synechococcus) dominated in the coastal waters. Our PC sequences are closely related to freshwater strains but differed from Baltic Sea strains, implying that they were from river discharge. Among PE-rich Synechococcus, clones grouping with strains containing only phycoerythrobilin (PEB-only) were abundant in July, while clones grouping with strains possessing a low content of phycourobilin (PUB) in addition to PEB (low PUB/PEB) were more abundant in January at both stations. Clones of high PUB/PEB types were only presented at the coastal station, but were not detected at the estuarine station. The much higher diversity of both PC-rich and PE-rich Synechococcus, as compared with the Baltic Sea, and the occurrence of the high PUB/PEB strains indicate the high dynamic nature of this subtropical estuarine-coastal environment with strong mixing of water masses ranging from Pearl River plume to oceanic South China Sea water. Our results of phylogenetic study agreed well with flow cytometric counts, which revealed the coexistence of PC-rich and PE-rich Synechococcus in the subtropical coastal waters and the dominance of the former type in the estuarine waters during summer high freshwater discharge. These results indicate that picocyanobacteria, particularly PC-rich Synechococcus, which has long been overlooked, are an important part of the primary production, and they could play an important role in the microbial food web in estuarine ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2013 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The uptake of these contaminants can occur from sediments, suspended particulate material, water-column and food-sources; and the major routes of input will depend on the particular dietary and ecological lifestyles of the organisms. Such a diverse array of chemicals can have many different mechanisms of toxicity, and several mechanisms may exist for a single contaminant, each contributing to various degrees to the final overall deleterious effect. Since the discovery of the importance of radical reactions in normal biological processes, and in the mechanisms of toxicity of many foreign compounds (xenobiotics), there has been an explosion of research into pro-oxidant and antioxidant processes, principally in mammalian systems. Of more recent interest has been evidence to indicate that contaminant-stimulated 'reactive oxygen species' (ROS) production and resulting oxidative damage may be a mechanism of toxicity in aquatic organisms exposed to pollution. The main aims of this short review are to briefly summarize current knowledge and recent advances in the understanding of such processes in aquatic organisms, and to assess these findings in relation to the key question of whether contaminant-stimulated ROS production and oxidative damage pose a threat to animal health and fitness in the aquatic environment.},

We investigated phytoplankton trait-environment relationships for over 300 taxa during the open-water season across 75 north-temperate lakes and reservoirs in Alberta, Canada. An innovative, data-driven approach was applied using iterative model selection for RLQ optimization to reveal key monthly associations. Fourth-corner analysis then tested the significance of relationships using spatially and phylogenetically constrained null models derived by Moran spectral randomization. Both local- and regional-scale drivers of succession were found with evidence of deterministic filtering by traits increasing in mid-summer. Trait associations to land-use and water quality highlighted potential anthropogenic cross-scale interactions, such as logging and pasture development affecting phytoplankton via allochthonous nutrient inputs. Biogeographic factors (e.g., elevation and habitat size) and associated temperature and chemical gradients (e.g., pH and bicarbonate) were also linked to multiple morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, including potential toxin production. Several correlated traits emphasized importance of trait syndromes corresponding to distinct taxonomic groups (e.g., cyanobacteria and green algae). However, rather than clustering species with shared ecological preferences or roles, our study builds on past trait-based approaches to phytoplankton by testing for explicit trait associations with a range of environmental factors. Thus, we provide a novel, quantitative means of revealing environmental constraints on communities and translating their compositional changes under climate and other human influences into functional impacts on freshwater ecosystems.},

Here we quantify how deforestation has already changed, and how future climate scenarios may change, environmental conditions within the highly disturbed Atlantic forests of Brazil. We also examine how environmental conditions have been altered within the range of selected bird species. Location: Atlantic forests of south-eastern Brazil. Methods: The historical distribution of 21 bird species was estimated using M. axent. After superimposing the present-day forest cover, we examined the environmental niches hypothesized to be occupied by these birds pre- and post-deforestation using environmental niche factor analysis (ENFA). ENFA was also used to compare conditions in the entire Atlantic forest ecosystem pre- and post-deforestation. The relative influence of land use and climate change on environmental conditions was examined using analysis of similarity and principal components analysis. Results: Deforestation in the region has resulted in a decrease in suitable habitat of between 78\% and 93\% for the Atlantic forest birds included here. Further, Atlantic forest birds today experience generally wetter and less seasonal forest environments than they did historically. Models of future environmental conditions within forest remnants suggest generally warmer conditions and lower annual variation in rainfall due to greater precipitation in the driest quarter of the year. We found that deforestation resulted in a greater divergence of environmental conditions within Atlantic forests than that predicted by climate change. Main conclusions: The changes in environmental conditions that have occurred with large-scale deforestation suggest that selective regimes may have shifted and, as a consequence, spatial patterns of intra-specific variation in morphology, behaviour and genes have probably been altered. Although the observed shifts in available environmental conditions resulting from deforestation are greater than those predicted by climate change, the latter will result in novel environments that exceed temperatures in any present-day climates and may lead to biotic attrition unless organisms can adapt to these warmer conditions. Conserving intra-specific diversity over the long term will require considering both how changes in the recent past have influenced contemporary populations and the impact of future environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

A core process is macronutrient uptake by microorganisms, as the uptake of nutrients controls ocean CO2 fixation rates in many regions. Here, we ask whether variations in ocean phytoplankton biodiversity lead to novel functional relationships between environmental variability and phosphate (Pi) uptake. We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans. Thus, it demonstrates that microbial biodiversity, beyond cell size, is important for understanding the global cycling of nutrients.},

Despite the potential implications of viral activity on the global carbon fluxes, studies investigating changes in the DOC composition from viral lysis is still lacking. Micromonas pusilla is an ecologically rele- vant picoeukaryotic phytoplankter, widely distributed in both coastal and oceanic marine waters. Viruses have been found to play a key role in regulating the population dynamics of this species. In this study we used axenic cultures of exponentially growing M. pusilla to determine the impact of viral lysis on the DOC concentration and composition, as estimated from lysate-derived production of transparent exo- polymer particles (TEP) and two fractions of fluores- cent dissolved organic matter (DOM): aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission; 280/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine humic-like fluorescent DOM (320/ 410 nm; F(320/410)). DOC concentration increased 4.5 times faster and reached 2.6 times higher end concentration in the viral infected compared with the non-infected cultures. The production of F(280/320) and F(320/410) were 4.1 and 2.8 times higher in the infected cultures, and the elevated ratio between F(280/320) and F(320/410) in lysates suggested a higher contribution of labile (protein) components in viral produced DOM than in algal exudates. The TEP production was 1.8 times faster and reached a 1.5 times higher level in the viral infected M. pusilla culture compared with the non- infected cultures. The measured increase in both DOC and TEP concentra- tions suggests that viral lysis has multiple and opposite implications for the production and export processes in the pelagic ocean: (1) by releasing host biomass as DOC it decreases the organic matter sedimentation and promotes respiration and nutrient retention in the photic zone, whereas (2) the observed enhanced TEP production could stimulate particle aggregation and thus carbon export out of the photic zone.},

Currently, ecotoxicological evaluations are considered insufficient to understand the environmental risks of stressor mixtures and their consequences in ecosystems. In addition, future global change scenarios could alter the predicted effects of agrochemicals in aquatic systems based on single exposures, making it necessary to consider the history of environmental disturbances that may result in vulnerability to subsequent environmental changes. The objectives of this study were to induce disturbance histories by exposure to sublethal glyphosate concentrations in microcosms and to assess whether this disturbance results in vulnerable populations using Daphnia magna as the target species. Populations were considered vulnerable if their sensitivity to new stressors (inanition, temperature and salinity) was higher than that of undisturbed populations. To induce disturbance history, microcosm aquatic communities (two cladocerans and one microalgae) were exposed to two glyphosate sublethal concentrations (below the No Observed Effect Concentration, NOEC values for D. magna, 0.1 and 1 mg L-1) in microcosms under controlled conditions in a culture chamber for 48 days. After this period, no significant differences were observed with respect to the control microcosms in the selected parameters (cladoceran abundance, microalgae cell abundance, microalgae colony formation, pH and dissolved oxygen). To test vulnerability, our target D. magna populations, which were previously exposed to different glyphosate treatments, were subjected to inanition, elevated temperature and salinity. Our results showed that D. magna populations with disturbance history performed worse in all the scenarios compared to the populations from undisturbed conditions. These results underscore the need to study how environmental disturbance history influences population responses to new and future stressors. Moreover, our findings raise concern regarding the sublethal effects of pesticides on aquatic populations.},

To quantify the phenotypic variation in needle morphology and anatomy in response to a climate gradient, we compared contrasted populations of Pinus canariensis grown in five sites inside and outside the natural distribution area of the species. Most needle and growth traits were strongly affected by site. In general, site xericity increased the relative area of the dermal and transfusion tissues and decreased mesophyll and endodermis. Within each site, provenances from less productive locations tended to show longer needles, less relative area of dermal tissues but higher relative area of mesophyll and transfusion tissue than provenances from fertile origins. Although sclerophylly increased with aridity, no genetic differences were found for this trait thus apparently the ontogenetic delay of some provenances in xeric environments was not related with the formation of tougher needles. Several patterns of phenotypic response to different environments were shown. In general, all traits were plastic but the degree of plasticity was higher in traits related with growth than foliar traits. These results, combined with formerly published research, suggest that highly plastic populations rather than narrowly specialized ones have been selected in this species to cope with the complex interaction of environmental factors in its habitat. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

However, the increasing of temperatures and more frequent water shortages could overcome the ability of long-lived species to cope with rapidly changing conditions. Growth and survival of natural populations adapted to a given site, transferred and tested in other environments as part of provenance trials, can be interpreted as a simulation of ambient changes at the original location. We compare the intraspecific variation and the relative contribution of plasticity to adaptation of key functional traits related to drought resistance: vulnerability to cavitation, efficiency of the xylem to conduct water and biomass allocation. We use six populations of Canary Island pine growing in three provenance trials (wet, dry, and xeric). We found that the variability for hydraulic traits was largely due to phenotypic plasticity, whereas, genetic variation was limited and almost restricted to hydraulic safety traits and survival. Trees responded to an increase in climate dryness by lowering growth, and increasing leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity by means of increasing the Huber value. Vulnerability to cavitation only showed a plastic response in the driest provenance trial located in the ecological limit of the species. This trait was more tightly correlated with annual precipitation, drought length, and temperature oscillation at the origin of the populations than hydraulic efficiency or the Huber value. Vulnerability to cavitation was directly related to survival in the dry and the xeric provenance trials, illustrating its importance in determining drought resistance. In a new climatic scenario where more frequent and intense droughts are predicted, the magnitude of extreme events together with the fact that plasticity of cavitation resistance is only shown in the very dry limit of the species could hamper the capacity to adapt and buffer against environmental changes of some populations growing in dry locations. \textcopyright{} 2016 L\'opez, Cano, Choat, Cochard and Gil.},

  abstract = {The resistance of an ecosystem to perturbations and the speed at which it recovers after the perturbations, which is called resilience, are two important components of ecosystem stability. It has been suggested that biodiversity increases the resilience and resistance of aggregated ecosystem processes. We test this hypothesis using a theoretical model of a nutrient-limited ecosystem in a heterogeneous environment. We investigate the stability properties of the model for its simplest possible configuration, i.e., a system consisting of two plant species and their associated detritus and local resource depletion zones. Phenotypic diversity within the plant community is described by differences in the nutrient uptake and mortality rates of the two species. The usual measure of resilience characterizes the system as a whole and thus also applies to aggregated ecosystem processes. As a rule this decreases with increased diversity, though under certain conditions it is maximum for an intermediate value of diversity. Resistance is a property that characterizes each system component and process separately. The resistance of the inorganic nutrient pools, hence of nutrient retention in the ecosystem, decreases with increased diversity. The resistance of both total plant biomass and productivity either monotonically decreases or increases over part of the parameter range with increased diversity. Furthermore, it is very sensitive to parameter values. These results support the view that there is no simple relationship between diversity and stability in equilibrium deterministic systems, whether at the level of populations or aggregated ecosystem processes. We discuss these results in relation to recent experiments.},

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines.

  abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution. \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

We found that many of the surveyed equations have comparable abilities to fit data and equally high requirements for data quality (number of test temperatures and range of response captured) but lead to different estimates of cardinal temperatures and of the biological rates at these temperatures. When these rate estimates are used for biogeographic predictions, differences between the estimates of even the best-fitting models can exceed the global biological change predicted for a decade of global warming.

  abstract = {Oxyrrhis marina is an extensively studied morphospecies and a common protist model used to examine a range of ecological processes. Further, as a result of a number of unusual cytological and genetic features, Oxyrrhis is increasingly a target for the study of evolutionary patterns and genome organization within the Alveolata. However, a small number of early morphological studies and recent phylogenetic data suggest that O. marina represents more than one species. As different research groups employ different O. marina isolates (which are potentially highly divergent strains or different species), the context in which comparisons between isolates can be made is difficult to assess. In this paper, we explore the literature that has contributed to the definition of O. marina, highlighting the unusual characteristics possessed by O. marina that have motivated much of the study on this organism and informed its key phylogenetic position. In addition, we assess historical and contemporary evidence for multiple Oxyrrhis species. Based on this assessment, in particular recent molecular genetic data, we assert that O. marina represents two species: O. marina and O. maritima. Based on historical observations, we also indicate that a third species (O. tenticulifera) may occur, although there are no contemporary data to support or refute this designation. Extensive cryptic diversity has important implications for researchers studying Oxyrrhis: caution must be exercised in characterizing Oxyrrhis isolates for experimental study (i.e. it is inappropriate to report assessments concerning poorly characterized isolates), and comparative studies of multiple isolates are required to assess individual, population and species level variation in the genus. Finally, in a broader context, the ecological and evolutionary processes driving diversity in free-living protists remains poorly understood. Model protists such as O. marina and O. maritima for which we are beginning to recognize and characterize an extensive pool of variation present ideal opportunities to unravel these fundamental processes. \textcopyright{} The Author 2010.

(2) Deep cloning was deemed more appropriate for the COI gene for population level studies, as direct sequencing could not easily capture the dominant haplotypes.

Histiobalantium bodamicum and Vorticella natans are common planktonic ciliates but their abundance, swimming behavior, and temperature tolerance are different. In contrast to most sessile peritrich species, the motile V. natans is not strictly bacterivorous but also voraciously feeds upon small algae. We observed three main alterations in the shape of NR of both species with temperature, that is, change in the maximum growth rate, in the initial slope and in the threshold food level needed to sustain the population. Similarly, maximum ingestion rate, gross growth efficiency (GGE), and cell size varied with temperature and species. These findings caution against generalizing ciliate performance in relation to the ongoing global warming. Our results suggest that V. natans is the superior competitor to H. bodamicum in terms of temperature tolerance and bottom-up control. However, the abundance of V. natans is usually low compared to H. bodamicum and other common freshwater ciliates, suggesting that V. natans is more strongly top-down controlled via predation than H. bodamicum. The taxonomic position of V. natans has been debated. Therefore, to confirm species and genus affiliation of our study objects, we sequenced their small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) gene.},

Their active pumping enables them to filter up to 900 times their body volume of water per hour, recycling nutrients and coupling a pelagic food supply with benthic communities. Despite the ecological importance of sponge filter feeding, little is known about how sponges control the water flow through their canal system or how much energy it costs to filter the water. Sponges have long been considered textbook examples of animals that use current-induced flow. We provide evidence that suggests that some species of demosponge do not use current-induced flow; rather, they respond behaviourally to increased ambient currents by reducing the volume of water filtered. Using a morphometric model of the canal system, we also show that filter feeding may be more energetically costly than previously thought. Measurements of volumetric flow rates and oxygen removal in five species of demosponge show that pumping rates are variable within and between species, with the more oxygen consumed the greater the volume filtered. Together, these data suggest that sponges have active control over the volume of water they process, which may be an adaptation to reduce the energetic cost of filtration in times of high stress.},

It is a model organism for studies of cyanobacterial metabolism and has great potential for biotechnological applications. It exhibits an exceptional tolerance of high light irradiation and shows very rapid growth. The habitats from which this and closely related strains were isolated are subject to changes in several environmental factors, including light, nutrient supply, temperature, and salinity. In this study global transcriptome profiling via RNAseq has been used to perform a comparative and integrated study of global changes in cells grown at different temperatures, at different salinities and under mixotrophic conditions, when a metabolizable organic carbon source was present. Furthermore, the transcriptomes were investigated for cells that were subjected to a heat shock and that were exposed to oxidative stress. Lower growth temperatures caused relatively minor changes of the transcriptome; the most prominent changes affected fatty acid desaturases. A heat shock caused severe changes of the transcriptome pattern; transcripts for genes associated with major metabolic pathways declined and those for different chaperones increased dramatically. Oxidative stress, however, left the transcript pattern almost unaffected. When grown at high salinity, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 had increased expression of genes involved in compatible solute biosynthesis and showed increased mRNA levels for several genes involved in electron transport. Transcripts of two adjacent genes dramatically increased upon growth at high salinity; the respective proteins are putatively involved in coping with oxidative stress and in triggering ion channels. Only minor changes were observed when cells were grown at low salinity or when the growth medium was supplemented with glycerol. However, the transcriptome data suggest that cells must acclimate to excess reducing equivalents when a reduced C-source is present.},

Here we modify this scheme by firstly allowing for a richer structure and secondly by testing whether we are able to eliminate the need for an explicit choice of features altogether. In the first case we allow for changing the number of features which define a species, as well as their nature, and find that in the resulting webs the higher trophic levels typically contain species with the greatest number of features. In the second case, by a simplification of the mechanisms for inter and intra-species competition, we construct a model without any explicit features and find that we are still able to grow model food webs.

Conversely, specific growth rates of the green alga C. sorokiniana were similar in blue and red light, but lower in orange light. Oxygen production rates of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were five-fold lower in blue than in orange and red light at low light intensities but approached the same saturation level in all three colors at high light intensities. Measurements of 77 K fluorescence emission demonstrated a lower ratio of photosystem I to photosystem II (PSI:PSII ratio) and relatively more phycobilisomes associated with PSII (state 1) in blue light than in orange and red light. These results support the hypothesis that blue light, which is not absorbed by phycobilisomes, creates an imbalance between the two photosystems of cyanobacteria with an energy excess at PSI and a deficiency at the PSII-side of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Our results help to explain why phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria use blue light less efficiently than species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae such as Prochlorococcus, green algae and terrestrial plants.},

  abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to environmental variation is a central goal in ecology. Plant communities respond to environmental gradients via intraspecific and/or interspecific variation in plant functional traits. However, the relative contribution of these two responses to environmental factors remains poorly tested. We measured six functional traits (height, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf carbon concentration (LCC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC)) for 55 tree species occurring at five elevations across a 1200 m elevational gradient of subalpine forests in Yulong Mountain, Southwest China. We examined the relative contribution of interspecific and intraspecific traits variability based on community weighted mean trait values and functional diversity, and tested how different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes (climate and soil variables). Species turnover explained the largest amount of variation in leaf morphological traits (leaf thickness and SLA) across the elevational gradient. However, intraspecific variability explained a large amount of variation (49.3\%-76.3\%) in three other traits (height, LNC and LPC) despite high levels of species turnover. The detection of limiting similarity in community assembly was improved when accounting for both intraspecific and interspecific variability. Different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes, especially soil water content and climatic variables. Our results indicate that intraspecific variation is critical for understanding community assembly and evaluating community response to environmental change.}

These extreme events are often of finite duration (pulse disturbances). Hence, while evolution during an extreme event may be adaptive, the resulting phenotypic changes may become maladaptive when the event ends. Using individual-based models and analytic approximations that fuse quantitative genetics and demography, we explore how heritability and phenotypic variance affect population size and extinction risk in finite populations under an extreme event of fixed duration. Since more evolution leads to greater malad-aptation and slower population recovery following an extreme event, greater heritability can increase extinction risk when the extreme event is short. Alternatively, when an extreme event is sufficiently long, heritability often helps a population persist. We also find that when events are severe, the buffering effect of phenotypic variance can outweigh the increased load it causes.},

Although MPAs manage for fishing pressure, many species and habitats in MPAs remain exposed to a multitude of stressors, including stressors from global climate change and regional land- and ocean-based activities. To support the adaptive management of MPAs that are subject to multiple interacting stressors, coastal managers need to understand the potential impacts from other single and multiple stressors. To demonstrate how this can be done, we quantify and map cumulative impacts resulting from multiple stressors to California's network of MPAs, using a widely available cumulative impacts mapping tool. Among individual stressors, those related to climate, including ocean acidification, UV radiation increases, and SST anomalies, were found to have the most intense impacts, especially on surface waters and in the rocky intertidal. Climate stressors are challenging to limit at the local MPA scale, but intense land- and ocean-based impacts that were found to affect a majority of MPAs, such as sediment increases, invasive species, organic pollutants and pollution from shipping and ports, may be more easily regulated at a regional or local scale. This is especially relevant for South and Central coast MPAs where these impacts are the greatest on beaches, tidal flats, and coastal marshes. Accounting for cumulative impacts from these and other stressors when developing monitoring and management plans in California and across the world, would help to improve the efficacy of MPAs.},

When faced with unfavorable environmental conditions, individuals have three non-exclusive options by which they can mitigate these changes: temporal alterations in phenology, spatial tracking of optimal conditions or in situ adaptation. For the latter to occur requires the existence of variability among conspecifics with respect to traits that directly or indirectly influence individual performance and fitness. One such "functional" trait is thermal stress tolerance. We investigated the presence of intraspecific functional trait variability of isofemale lineages of the free-living marine nematode Litoditis marina in monoculture, double and quadruple mixtures under thermal stress, which was applied in a gradient and a sudden treatment over 20. days, corresponding to at least four generations. We found a high degree of intraspecific functional trait variability relevant to thermal tolerance. This type of variability has traditionally been considered negligible compared to interspecific variation, but our results demonstrate the importance of its inclusion within trait-based eco-evolutionary studies as this will confer increased accuracy when inputting physiological parameters to relevant models (e.g. species distribution models). Additionally, we found a significant effect of the temperature treatments. In accordance with the majority of experimental evidence, our populations showed a stronger response to a sudden versus a gradient increase in temperature. Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were observed between monocultures, double and quadruple lineage mixtures suggesting that increased intraspecific trait variability did not lead to higher fitness in L. marina populations exposed to thermal stress.},

Many introduced species have a strong negative influence on the new local environment and lead to high economic costs. There is a strong interest to understand why some species are successful in invading new environments and others not. Most of our understanding and generalizations thereof, however, are based on studies of plants and animals, and little is known on invasion processes of microorganisms. We conducted a microcosm experiment to understand factors promoting the success of biological invasions of aquatic microorganisms. In a controlled lab experiment, protist and rotifer species originally isolated in North America invaded into a natural, field-collected community of microorganisms of European origin. To identify the importance of environmental disturbances on invasion success, we either repeatedly disturbed the local patches, or kept them as undisturbed controls. We measured both short-term establishment and long-term invasion success, and correlated it with species-specific life-history traits. We found that environmental disturbances significantly affected invasion success. Depending on the invading species' identity, disturbances were either promoting or decreasing invasion success. The interaction between habitat disturbance and species identity was especially pronounced for long-term invasion success. Growth rate was the most important trait promoting invasion success, especially when the species invaded into a disturbed local community. We conclude that neither species traits nor environmental factors alone conclusively predict invasion success, but an integration of both of them is necessary.}

  abstract = {Biological invasions threaten biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, requiring substantial conservation and management efforts. To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1149 scientific articles mentioning both `conservation planning' and `alien' or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10\% focused on the marine one. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46\% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13\% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73\%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20\% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6\% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e. alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the `avoid' approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a `protect' or `avoid' approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment. Gaps and needs for further research are discussed and we propose an 11-step framework to account for biological invasions into the systematic conservation planning design.},

Increases in intraspecific litter diversity increased soil respiration overall, with the greatest increases in respiration occurring under high nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen deposition increased the amount of inorganic nitrogen leached, while the amount of dissolved organic nitrogen leached was correlated with initial litter chemistry (lignin concentration) and remained independent of litter diversity and nitrogen deposition treatments.

Land-based raceway nurseries dependent on seawater natural production may be economically feasible for growing Peden maximus spat during the summer season, but little is known regarding natural food conditions and scallop spat growth during autumn conditions. Scallop growth was monitored together with several water parameters from summer toward the end of the growth season in November. Three raceways were used for the experiment and were loaded with an increasing biomass of large scallops (26, 52, and 78 kg) to reveal the effect of different food concentrations being offered to the spat. Experimental scallop spat (12.94 +/- 0.142 mm) were kept in stacked trays and placed after (downstream from) the biomass loads. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, particulate organic material, particulate inorganic material, algal species composition, and particle size distribution were monitored throughout the experimental period, but did not change systematically with the biomass loads. The temperature was 15 degrees C at the start and 9 degrees C by the end of the experimental period. Chlorophyll a values were low (\textexclamdown 1.0 mu g/L) except for the diatom bloom on September 13, when it reached 3.21 mu g/L. Particulate organic material varied between 1.6-2.3 mg/L. Shell height and live weight biomass differed significantly between the control group and the 3 experimental groups, whereas there was no significant difference among the experimental groups. Growth slowed after mid September and stopped in the experimental groups in October, whereas the control group continued growing until November. Growth was affected by increased biomass load in the raceways after the diatom bloom. We conclude that a raceway nursery could hold large biomass of scallop spat during early autumn conditions, but 4 wk after the autumn bloom the production was limited by the poorer quantity and quality of the particulate matter.},

Here, we developed some novel approaches to species distribution modeling aimed at reducing the influences of such challenges and improving the realism of projections. We estimated species-environment relationships for Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) with four modeling methods run with multiple scenarios of (i) sources of occurrences and geographically isolated background ranges for absences, (ii) approaches to drawing background (absence) points, and (iii) alternate sets of predictor variables. We further tested various quantitative metrics of model evaluation against biological insight. Model projections were very sensitive to the choice of training dataset. Model accuracy was much improved using a global dataset for model training, rather than restricting data input to the species' native range. AUC score was a poor metric for model evaluation and, if used alone, was not a useful criterion for assessing model performance. Projections away from the sampled space (i.e., into areas of potential future invasion) were very different depending on the modeling methods used, raising questions about the reliability of ensemble projections. Generalized linear models gave very unrealistic projections far away from the training region. Models that efficiently fit the dominant pattern, but exclude highly local patterns in the dataset and capture interactions as they appear in data (e.g., boosted regression trees), improved generalization of the models. Biological knowledge of the species and its distribution was important in refining choices about the best set of projections. A post hoc test conducted on a new Parthenium dataset from Nepal validated excellent predictive performance of our 'best' model. We showed that vast stretches of currently uninvaded geographic areas on multiple continents harbor highly suitable habitats for parthenium. However, discrepancies between model predictions and parthenium invasion in Australia indicate successful management for this globally significant weed.},

A main objective of plant ecology is to quantify the correlations among traits and ask why some of them are sufficiently closely coordinated to form a single axis of functional specialization. However, due to trait co-variations in nature, it is difficult to propose a mechanistic and causal explanation for the origin of trade-offs among traits observed at both intra- and inter-specific level.Methodology/Principal Findings:Using the Gemini individual-centered model which coordinates physiological and morphological processes, we investigated with 12 grass species the consequences of deliberately decoupling variation of leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf lifespan) and plant stature (height and tiller number) on plant growth and phenotypic variability. For all species under both high and low N supplies, simulated trait values maximizing plant growth in monocultures matched observed trait values. Moreover, at the intraspecific level, plastic trait responses to N addition predicted by the model were in close agreement with observed trait responses. In a 4D trait space, our modeling approach highlighted that the unique trait combination maximizing plant growth under a given environmental condition was determined by a coordination of leaf, root and whole plant processes that tended to co-limit the acquisition and use of carbon and of nitrogen.Conclusion/Significance:Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the origin of trade-offs between plant functional traits and further predicts plasticity in plant traits in response to environmental changes. In a multidimensional trait space, regions occupied by current plant species can therefore be viewed as adaptive corridors where trait combinations minimize allometric and physiological constraints from the organ to the whole plant levels. The regions outside this corridor are empty because of inferior plant performance. \textcopyright{} 2013 Maire et al.}

  abstract = {Organic chemicals can contribute to local and regional losses of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, their overall relevance regarding larger spatial scales remains unknown. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first risk assessment of organic chemicals on the continental scale comprising 4,000 European monitoring sites. Organic chemicals were likely to exert acute lethal and chronic long-term effects on sensitive fish, invertebrate, or algae species in 14\% and 42\% of the sites, respectively. Of the 223 chemicals monitored, pesticides, tributyltin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and brominated flame retardants were the major contributors to the chemical risk. Their presence was related to agricultural and urban areas in the upstream catchment. The risk of potential acute lethal and chronic long-term effects increased with the number of ecotoxicologically relevant chemicals analyzed at each site. As most monitoring programs considered in this study only included a subset of these chemicals, our assessment likely underestimates the actual risk. Increasing chemical risk was associated with deterioration in the quality status of fish and invertebrate communities. Our results clearly indicate that chemical pollution is a large-scale environmental problem and requires far-reaching, holistic mitigation measures to preserve and restore ecosystem health.},

  abstract = {Within-species and among-species differences in growth responses to a changing climate have been well docu- mented, yet the relative magnitude of within-species vs. among-species variation has remained largely unexplored. This missing comparison impedes our ability to make general predictions of biodiversity change and to project future species distributions using models. We present a direct comparison of among- versus within-species variation in response to three of the main stresses anticipated with climate change: drought, warming, and frost. Two earlier experiments had experimentally induced (i) summer drought and (ii) spring frost for four common European grass species and their ecotypes from across Europe. To supplement existing data, a third experiment was carried out, to compare variation among species from different functional groups to within-species variation. Here, we simulated (iii) winter warming plus frost for four grasses, two nonleguminous, and two leguminous forbs, in addition to eleven European ecotypes of the widespread grass Arrhenatherum elatius. For each experiment, we measured: (i) C/N ratio and biomass, (ii) chlorophyll content and biomass, and (iii) plant greenness, root 15N uptake, and live and dead tissue mass. Using coefficients of variation (CVs) for each experiment and response parameter, a total of 156 within- vs. among-species comparisons were conducted, comparing within-species variation in each of four species with among- species variation for each seed origin (five countries). Of the six significant differences, within-species CVs were higher than among-species CVs in four cases. Partitioning of variance within each treatment in two of the three exper- iments showed that within-species variability (ecotypes) could explain an additional 9\% of response variation after accounting for the among-species variation. Our observation that within-species variation was generally as high as among-species variation emphasizes the importance of including both within- and among-species variability in eco- logical theory (e.g., the insurance hypothesis) and for practical applications (e.g., biodiversity conservation).},

The variation has been classified by several authors, but in most cases the distinctions between their main categories have depended on the number of gametes produced per gametangium (and thus on how many zygotes per pair of copulating cells), and upon whether fusion is oogamous, anisogamous or isogamous. These classifications are not themselves an adequate basis for taxonomic comparison, which should be based on individual characteristics of the sexual process. Diatoms seem to be primitively oogamous. In araphid pennate diatoms and some raphid diatoms the gametes and gametangia are morphologically alike but physiologically distinct; one gametangium produces active gametes and the other passive ones. This may be the primitive condition in pennate diatoms, providing a link to the oogamy of centrics via the morphological anisogamy of Rhabdonema Kuetz.},

This and other characteristics, particularly the presence of rimoportulae, are consistent with the hypothesis that Eunotia is a basal lineage within the raphid group. We studied auxosporulation in E. bilunaris (Ehrenberg) Mills and E. tropica Hustedt for comparison with other raphid pennate diatoms and with araphid pennates; E. bilunaris was studied in parental and F1 generations. Like araphid pennates, E. bilunaris and E. tropica are heterothallic. Clones of the same mating type did not interact sexually, and intraclonal sexual reproduction was absent or very rare. Clones retained the same sex throughout the life cycle, as shown by experiments using abrupt size reduction to produce clones of similar age but different size and using subclones derived from a single initial cell within six mitotic generations. Unlike in araphid pennate diatoms, in the Eunotia species the gametes are not visibly or behaviorally differentiated. Gametogenesis is merogenous, because the gametangium formed a supernumerary cell as well as a single gametic cell, both undergoing meiosis II to form a surviving functional nucleus and a nucleus that quickly degenerated. Plasmogamy is via papillae that grew out toward each other from the ends of the gametangia to create a copulation canal. After plasmogamy, the gametes moves bodily into the copulation canal, producing an elongate zygote, which expands to form a curved sausage-like auxospore.},

Our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the variability in phytoplankton size structure has been shaped by the assumption that the pace of metabolism decreases allometrically with increasing cell size. However, recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that biomass-specific production and growth rates are similar in both small and large cells but peak at intermediate cell sizes. The maximum nutrient uptake rate scales isometrically with cell volume and superisometrically with the minimum nutrient quota. The unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from ataxonomic, size-dependent trade-off processes related to nutrient requirement, acquisition, and use. The superior ability of intermediate-size cells to exploit high nutrient concentrations explains their biomass dominance during blooms. Biogeographic patterns in phytoplankton size structure and growth rate are independent of temperature and driven mainly by changes in resource supply.},

The three principal woody species of the Sierras Grandes Mountains of central Argentina have marked differences in sapling performance along their altitudinal distribution. We hypothesize that the steep gradient of climatic conditions across the species' altitudinal distribution promotes trait differences between populations of different altitudes that are inherited by the following generation. Seeds from different altitudes were exposed to three temperature regimes to assess differential germination responses. Saplings were then transplanted to a greenhouse to assess possible variations in attributes and performance after 18 months. The three species showed differences in germination responses to temperature among altitudes and/or in sapling attributes and performance. In Maytenus boaria and Escallonia cordobensis, germination success was higher under high temperatures for the highest-altitude, whereas lower temperatures boosted germination of the lowest altitudes. Polylepis australis showed no differences in germination among temperature treatments. In the greenhouse, saplings of the three species from intermediate altitudes showed high performance, whereas the upper and lower populations seemed to be adjusted to tolerating more stressful conditions (i.e., lower temperatures at the upper end and water stress at the lower end), showing lower performance toward both altitudinal limits. These patterns agree with those described for saplings growing under field conditions, suggesting adjustments in response to environmental changes undergone by populations along the altitudinal range. The marked adjustments of populations to the local environment suggest a potentially high impact of climatic change on species distribution. \textcopyright{} 2016 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands},

Previous information on non-breeding skimmers obtained through conventional methodologies suggested sex-related differences in prey species. In this study, stable isotope techniques were used to investigate the intraspecific segregation in diet and foraging habits of the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger intercedens) at Mar Chiquita Coastal Lagoon (37\textdegree 40{${'}$}S, 57\textdegree 22{${'}$}W), Argentina. These results were compared with contemporary data on the trophic composition obtained by conventional methodologies. Blood samples were taken from birds captured with mist-nets during their non-breeding season. The isotopic signatures of skimmers showed a diet mainly composed of marine prey with some degree of estuarine fish intake. When comparing diet between sexes, males showed enrichment in 15N compared to females, while no differences were observed in 13C. The use of mixing models revealed differences in the relative composition of prey in the diet of male and female skimmers. This study highlights stable isotope analysis as a valuable tool to test inter-individual differences and sexual segregation in trophic ecology of Black Skimmers as compared to conventional methodologies. The results show a trophic segregation in the Black Skimmer during the non-breeding season that can be explained by differences in prey species and larger prey sizes of male skimmers. Our findings have significant implications for conservation since any environmental change occurring at wintering areas might have profound effects on several avian life-history traits, and could be different for males and females due to trophic segregation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer-Verlag.}

In recent years, their diversity has been studied by the analysis of 18S rRNA gene sequences directly amplified and cloned from filtered natural samples. However, these clone libraries are often dominated by nonphotosynthetic organisms and few sequences from autotrophs are recovered. In the present paper, we developed a new approach based on flow cytometry. Photosynthetic pico-, nano- and phycoerythrin-containing (PE-) eukaryotes from the coastal English Channel were sorted based on their size and pigment fluorescence. 18S rRNA gene libraries were constructed from the DNA of sorted cells. We addressed methodological issues linked to the relatively low concentration of these cells. This novel approach confirmed that, in the English Channel, pico-eukaryotes are dominated by three genera Micromonas, Ostreococcus and Bathycoccus, while PE-eukaryotes are mainly cryptophytes from clade 4. It also revealed that nano-eukaryotes are dominated by haptophytes with important contributions from small diatoms and Prasinophyceae. It should be emphasized that haptophytes were nearly absent from clone libraries constructed from filtered samples, which explains why they have been overlooked in previous studies. The new strategy should be very useful to conduct similar studies on other specific populations that can be discriminated by flow cytometry (e.g. red tide organisms or uncultivated protists).},

The quantification of the catalytic activity for superoxide dismutase is quite complex because its substrate is an unstable free radical. Several methods have been developed for this enzymatic activity determination; most of them are based on inhibition of a redox reaction involving the superoxide radical. In this work, two methods are compared, for crude sponge extracts, as far as repeatability, reproducibility and sensibility are concerned. The adrenaline oxidation method seems to be the most adequate for these determinations. Statistical treatment of the data indicates that the reference value for the specific superoxide dismutase activity in C. celata should be in the interval 0-535.5 U/mg of total protein in wet tissues, for normal populations.},

In this contribution, we develop a stochastic model to analytically account for this distribution (SPAD). We show that the same as for genes SPAD follows a beta distribution, which provides a good description of empirical data and applies across a continuum of scales. This stochastic model, based upon a diffusion approximation, provides an alternative to neutral models for the species abundance distribution (SAD), which focus on number of individuals instead of proportions, and demonstrate that the relative frequency of genes in local populations and of species within communities follow the same probability law. We hope our contribution will help stimulate the mathematical and conceptual integration of theories in genetics and ecology.},

A solution of 1 mu g/mL of the fluorochrome allowed viability of the prey for at least 48 hours, provided low fluorescence quenching, and labelled the flagellate without masking the cytoplasm. After 2 hours of contact between the fluorescent prey and the predator, O. marina population had preyed on live G. amphinema at an ingestion rate of 2.2 prey Oxyrrhis(-1) h(-1). Results show that this model is a time-effective and inexpensive approach for the direct observation of heterotrophic flagellate grazing.

Herein, we address the question as to whether ciliates can serve as a trophic link between picocyanobacterial production and Daphnia spp. production, thereby upgrading the nutritional value of a picocyanobacterial food source by producing essential lipids such as PUFAs or sterols. In simplified experimental food chains consisting of 1 of 2 different Synechococcus strains, the ciliates Colpidium campylum or Cyclidium sp., and D. magna, we provided evidence that predation on ciliates by Daphnia spp. allows access to picocyanobacterial production. Since daphnids are primarily sterol-limited when grown on the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus spp., the observed trophic upgrading of Synechococcus food-quality by intermediary ciliates is most probably due to the addition of sterols or sterol-like compounds that (at least partly) release Daphnia spp. from sterol limitation. The absence of sterols in the ciliates used in the present study suggests that tetrahymanol and/or hopanoids provide functional equivalents of sterols not only in ciliates but also in Daphnia spp., thereby leading to enhanced growth of the cladocerans.},

Viromic studies typically require large sample volumes and filtration through 0.2 mum pore-size filters, consequently excluding or under-sampling tailed and very large viruses. We have optimized a targeted viromic approach that employs fluorescence-activated sorting and whole genome amplification to produce dsDNA-enriched libraries from discrete viral populations from a 1-ml water sample. Using this approach on an environmental sample from the Patagonian Shelf, we produced three distinct libraries. One of the virus libraries was dominated (79.65\% of sequences with known viral homology) by giant viruses from the Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae families, while the two other viromes were dominated by smaller phycodnaviruses, cyanophages and other bacteriophages. The estimated genotypic richness and diversity in our sorted viromes, with 52-163 estimated genotypes, was much lower than in previous virome reports. Fragment recruitment of metagenome reads to selected reference viral genomes yields high genome coverage, suggesting little amplification and sequencing bias against some genomic regions. These results underscore the value of our approach as an effective way to target and investigate specific virus groups. In particular, it will help reveal the diversity and abundance of giant viruses in marine ecosystems.},

We explored geographic variation in demographic rates of an exploited benthic species, the wavy-turban snail Megastraea undosa, along the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico. We compared key life-history traits (i.e. fecundity, size at maturity, growth, and survivorship) of populations existing between 20 and 170 km apart under different conditions of ocean temperature and food availability. Trade-offs between growth and reproduction were evident across this environmental gradient, with higher growth rates in warmer locations leading to lower size-specific investment in gonad production. Because later onset of reproduction in populations from warmer areas was compensated by greater fecundity at larger sizes, geographic variation in life-history strategies resulted in similar age-specific reproductive output among different populations. However, we observed that, while there is substantial variation in demographic rates of the study species, harvest management is applied uniformly, and this results in southern populations achieving lower reproductive output before they reach a legally harvestable size. Our results highlight the importance of considering geographic variation in multiple life-history traits when managing across a mosaic of land- and seascapes characterized by varying environmental conditions. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2012.},

Increasing sea surface temperatures are predicted to affect many biological processes including sponge heterotrophy. Sponges are a vital component in benthic-pelagic coupling, and therefore these organisms have a significant impact on bacterioplankton communities. Elevated water temperatures may 1) affect sponge pumping behavior by elevating or depressing filtration rates, 2) modify the basic feeding behavior of the sponge, and 3) negatively impact the host's symbiotic microbial communities. Here, we examined the effects of thermal stress on feeding behavior in the common Great Barrier Reef sponge, Rhopaloeides odorabile, primarily focusing on filtration efficiencies and choanocyte chamber characteristics. Temperatures below 31 ??C had little effect on sponge feeding behavior. At 31 ??C, however, flow rate, filtration efficiency, and choanocyte chamber density and size were all reduced, and temperatures above 31 ??C were lethal. Sponges were found to shift feeding preferences towards phototrophic bacteria at 31 ??C, and there was a strong correlation between pumping rate and choanocyte chamber density. Notably, R. odorabile was able to recover from thermal stress within 48 hours if returned to 27 ??C. Our results clearly indicate that ecologically realistic temperatures have deleterious effects on sponge feeding behavior. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity is thought to provide insurance for ecosystem functioning under heterogeneous environments; however, such insurance potential is under serious threat following unprecedented loss of biodiversity. One of the key mechanism underlying ecological insurance is that niche differentiation allows asynchronous responses to fluctuating environments, although the role of different ecological strategies (e.g., specialists vs. generalists) has yet to be formally evaluated. We present here a simple experimental study that illustrates how different ecological strategies (i.e., generalists vs. specialists) can shape the biodiversity-insurance relationship. We assembled microcosm of generalists and specialist bacteria over a gradient of salinity and found that, bacterial communities made up of generalists were more productive and more stable over time under environmental fluctuations. We discuss our results in context with simple theoretical predictions and propose future directions for biological insurance theory. We argue that beyond species richness itself, it is essential to incorporate the distribution of ecological strategies across relevant environmental gradients as predictors of the insurance potential of biodiversity in natural ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2013 Matias, Combe, Barbera and Mouquet.},

As such, inherent inter-individual differences within populations may lead to context-dependent changes in behavior with animal body size, which is of concern for understanding population dynamics and optimizing ecological monitoring. Using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from concurrently sampled tissues, we quantified the direction and magnitude of intraspecific variation in trophic shifts among three shark species, and how these changed with body size: spurdogs (Squalus spp.) in deep-sea habitats off La R\'eunion, bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in estuarine habitats of the Florida Everglades, and blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in coral reef ecosystems of Moorea, French Polynesia. Intraspecific variation in trophic shifts was limited among spurdogs, and decreased with body size, while bull sharks exhibited greater individual differences in trophic shifts, but also decreased in variability through ontogeny. In contrast, blacktip reef sharks exhibited increased intraspecific variation in trophic interactions with body size. Variability in trophic interactions and ontogenetic shifts are known to be associated with changes in energetic requirements, but can vary with ecological context. Our results suggest that environmental stability may affect variability within populations, and ecosystems with greater spatial and/or temporal variability in environmental conditions, and those with more diverse food webs may facilitate greater individual differences in trophic interactions, and thus ontogenetic trophic shifts. In light of concerns over environmental disturbance, elucidating the contexts that promote or dampen phenotypic variability is invaluable for predicting population- and community-level responses to environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Equal amounts of donor and recipient bacteria were mixed together in the presence or absence of protozoa (ciliates, free-living amoebae, myxamoebae) in Page's amoeba saline for 24 h. Transconjugants were selected with Luria Broth agar containing kanamycin and ciprofloxacin. The frequency of conjugation was estimated as the number of transconjugants for each recipient. Conjugation frequency in the presence of ciliates was estimated to be approximately 10-6, but in the absence of ciliates, or in the presence of other protozoa, it was approximately 10-8. Conjugation also occurred in culture of ciliates at least 2 h after incubation. Successful conjugation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Addition of cycloheximide or latrunculin B resulted in suppression of conjugation. Heat killing the ciliates or bacteria had no effect on conjugation frequency. Co-localization of green fluorescent protein-expressing E. coli and PKH67-vital stained E. coli was observed in the same ciliate vesicles, suggesting that both donor and recipient bacteria had accumulated in the same vesicle. In this study, the conjugation frequency of bacteria was found to be significantly higher in vesicles purified from ciliates than those in culture suspension. We conclude that ciliates rapidly enhance the conjugation of E. coli strains through bacterial accumulation in vesicles.}

However, an overview characteris- ing the spread and impacts of the quagga mussel in this area is currently lacking. A literature study, supple- mented with field data, was performed to gather all available data and information relating to quagga mussel dispersal. Dispersal characteristics were ana- lysed for rate and direction and in relation to hydrological connectivity and dispersal vectors. To determineranges of conditions suitable for quagga mussel colonisation, physico-chemical characteristics of their habitats were analysed. After its initial arrival in the freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary and River Danube, the quagga mussel demonstrated a rapid and continued range expansion in Western Europe. Quagga mussels have extended their non- native range to the network of major waterways in The Netherlands and in an upstream direction in the River Rhine (Germany), its tributaries (rivers Main and Moselle) and the River Meuse (Belgium and France). The calculated average quagga mussel dispersal rate in Europe was 120 km year-1 (range 23\textendash 383 km year-1). Hydrological connectivity is important in determining the speed with which colonisation occurs. Dispersal to water bodies discon- nected from the freshwater network requires the presence of a suitable vector e.g. pleasure boats transferred over land. Upstream dispersal is primarily human mediated through the attachment of mussels to watercraft. The relative abundance of quagga mussel to zebra mussel has greatly increased in a number of areas sampled in the major Dutch rivers and lakes and the rivers Main and Rhine and the Rhine\textendash Danube Canal leading to a dominance shift from zebra mussels to quagga mussels. However, evidence for displace- ment of the zebra mussel is limited due to the lack of temporal trends relating to the overall density of zebra and quagga mussel.},

  abstract = {Although harmful cyanobacteria form a major threat to water quality, few methods exist for the rapid suppression of cyanobacterial blooms. Since laboratory studies indicated that cyanobacteria are more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) than eukaryotic phytoplankton, we tested the application of H 2O 2 in natural waters. First, we exposed water samples from a recreational lake dominated by the toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii to dilute H 2O 2. This reduced the photosynthetic vitality by more than 70\% within a few hours. Next, we installed experimental enclosures in the lake, which revealed that H 2O 2 selectively killed the cyanobacteria without major impacts on eukaryotic phytoplankton, zooplankton, or macrofauna. Based on these tests, we introduced 2mgL -1 (60{$\mu$}M) of H 2O 2 homogeneously into the entire water volume of the lake with a special dispersal device, called the water harrow. The cyanobacterial population as well as the microcystin concentration collapsed by 99\% within a few days. Eukaryotic phytoplankton (including green algae, cryptophytes, chrysophytes and diatoms), zooplankton and macrofauna remained largely unaffected. Following the treatment, cyanobacterial abundances remained low for 7 weeks. Based on these results, we propose the use of dilute H 2O 2 for the selective elimination of harmful cyanobacteria from recreational lakes and drinking water reservoirs, especially when immediate action is urgent and/or cyanobacterial control by reduction of eutrophication is currently not feasible. A key advantage of this method is that the added H 2O 2 degrades to water and oxygen within a few days, and thus leaves no long-term chemical traces in the environment. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whistles are extensively studied in delphinids, where several factors have been proposed to explain between- and within-species variation. We examined factors associated with geographic variation in whistles of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) by assessing the role of ambient noise, noise from boats, and sympatry with other dolphin species, and reviewing and comparing whistle structure across populations in the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean. Whistles of adjacent populations differed, particularly in frequency parameters. A combination of factors may contribute to microgeographic whistle variation, including differences in ambient noise levels (dolphins produced relatively higher frequency whistles in the noisiest habitat), and differences in number of boats present (when multiple boats were present, dolphins whistled with greater frequency modulation and whistles were higher in maximum frequency and longer than when a single boat was present). Whistles produced by adjacent populations were relatively similar in structure. However, for clearly separated populations, the distance between them did not relate directly to whistle structure. We propose that plasticity in bottlenose dolphin whistles facilitates adaptation to local and changing conditions of their habitat, thus promoting variation between populations at different geographic scales. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.},

Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure. \textcopyright{} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

The present work was aimed at establishing whether, in such a dynamic and variable environment, species associations and homogeneous periods could be identified as characteristic and stable features of the mesozooplankton over the period 1984\textendash 2006. Hierarchical clustering was applied to assess species associations based on a matrix of similarities between species (R-mode), and homogeneous periods based on a matrix of similarities between observations (Q-mode). The Indicator Value index [IndVal, Dufrene and Legendre (1997) Species assemblages and indicator species: the need for a flexible asymmetrical approach. Ecol.

Five taxonomic groups with well-defined composition and abundance were identified as robust associations that likely reflect different modes of community functioning. The temporal course of these associations was largely shaped by strong seasonal forcing comprising both physical and biological (e.g. trophic) signals. These associations persisted over the long term, thus indicating some stable characters in the Naples zooplankton time-series, providing evidence of resilience in communities in highly variable coastal conditions.},

However, despite extensive examination of the effects of stressors in isolation, knowledge of the effects of stressors in combination is limited. This lack of information makes predicting the responses of organisms to anthropogenic environmental change challenging. Here, we focus on the effects of temperature and hypoxia as interacting stressors in fishes. A review of the available evidence suggests that temperature and hypoxia act synergistically such that small shifts in one stressor could result in large effects on organismal performance when a fish is exposed to the 2 stressors in combination. Although these stressors pose substantial challenges for fish, there also is substantial intraspecific variation in tolerance to these stressors that could act as the raw material for the evolution of improved tolerance. However, the potential for adaptive change is, in part, dependent on the nature of the correlations among traits associated with tolerance. For example, negative genetic correlations (or trade-offs) between tolerances to temperature and hypoxia could limit the potential for adaptation to the combined stressors, while positive genetic correlations might be of benefit. The limited data currently available suggest that tolerances to hypoxia and to higherature may be positively correlated in some species of fish, suggesting the possibility for adaptive evolution in these traits in response to anthropogenic environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author.

  abstract = {1. Optimal partitioning theory (OPT) suggests that plants should allocate biomass to the organ that acquires the most limiting resource. An implied assumption of this is that there are trade-offs in allocation between leaf, stem and root functions. 2. Recently, an alternative approach, allometric biomass partitioning theory (APT), was developed to predict how plants should divide their metabolic production between leaves, stems and roots, based on the constraints of body size. APT predicts that, for an allometrically ideal plant, leaf mass should scale to the 3/4th power of body size, and stem and root mass should scale isometrically to body size. 3. In this study, we combine OPT with APT by investigating biomass partitioning not accounted for by allometric constraints across broad environmental gradients. 4. Intraspecific variability in biomass allocation shows correlations with environmental factors that would be predicted by OPT. However, interspecifically, these patterns either do not appear or are greatly reduced. 5. Our study suggests that, after size is accounted for, intraspecific residual variation in biomass allocation may be partially explained by environmental factors in a manner consistent with OPT. However, the particular patterns vary between species, obscuring large-scale patterns. 6. In summary, differences due to environmental variability can be incorporated with allocation patterns related to total mass to help understand how plants should allocate biomass in response to changes in both size and environment. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.},

These analyses provide an approach for synthesising across species and can better inform ecological responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Author.

Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

Zooplankton are sensitive to increasing chloride but few studies have considered how additional stressors, such as soft water or increasing lake temperatures interact with the negative effects of chloride. To determine the effects of increasing chloride and temperature on freshwater zooplankton and phytoplankton communities, we conducted a mesocosm experiment using 30 concentrations of chloride from ambient levels to 1500 mg L-1, ambient or warmed (+2.7\textdegree C) temperatures, and plankton from a softwater lake. We compared the results with current Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) for chronic exposure to chloride. Although warming elicited little response, increasing chloride concentrations led to reduced zooplankton biomass and richness, even at concentrations below the CWQG, and an increase in cyanobacteria abundance, suggesting that policies regulating road salt application should be reevaluated to better protect aquatic ecosystems.}

  abstract = {Macroecology proceeds by identifying patterns and then identifying processes that cause those patterns. Most of the processes that macroecologists study are local in nature and tend to involve species interactions and speciation and extinction processes. In contrast, we propose that several important macroecological patterns can be explained by very large-scale processes that are primarily spatial in nature. Specifically, we suggest that the structure of abundance across a species' entire range combined with interspecific patterns in range location and global abundance can explain the well-known macroecological patterns of: (1) a positive correlation between range size and abundance, (2) the species-area relationship, (3) decay of species similarity with distance and (4) the species abundance distribution. We show that spatial processes produce these patterns through a combination of analytical and Monte Carlo analysis. We also show that the connection is robust (indifferent) to the precise mathematical assumptions. Such a theory might be called a unified theory, because it explains multiple patterns with a few processes. To differentiate among the growing number of unified theories, we suggest that testing additional predictions over and above producing curves of the correct shape is important. To this end, we present several novel, quantitative predictions and provide empirical tests. In short, we provide an empirically grounded and tested theory, which suggests that superimposing individual species ranges across space creates local community patterns.},

  abstract = {Algal and cyanobacterial blooms in reservoirs are driven by nutrient enrichment and may present economic and conservation challenges for water managers. Current approaches such as suppression of algal growth with barley straw, ferric dosing or manipulation of fish stocks have not yielded long term successes. A possibility that has sparked growing interest is the encouragement and cultivation of natural filter feeders, such as mussels, which remove suspended matter from the water and reduce nutrient levels through biodeposition and assimilation.This review focusses on the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as a tool for enhancement of water quality in reservoirs. Native to the Ponto-Caspian region, this species has invaded many lakes and reservoirs across North America and Western Europe, where it occurs in very high densities. While purposeful introduction of a non-native species into new sites is socially unacceptable, we investigate the possible benefits of encouraging increased abundance of zebra mussels in sites where the species is already established.We estimate that the annual nitrogen and phosphorus input into a large UK reservoir (Grafham Water) could be assimilated into zebra mussel biomass by encouraging settlement onto 3075m and 1400m of commercial mussel ropes, respectively. While zebra mussel cultivation has an incredible capacity to push eutrophic systems towards a clear water state, there are many risks associated with encouraging an invasive species, even within sites where it has already established. The zebra mussel is a prominent biofouler of native unionid mussels and raw water pipes, it changes the physical characteristics of the places it inhabits, in sites low in phosphorus it can be responsible for toxic cyanobacterial blooms, it alters nutrient cycling and community structure and it can have negative impacts on amenity value. Increased propagule pressure from elevated numbers of veliger larvae in the water column may increase the risk of spread to other locations. This may render some reservoir systems, such as dammed rivers which have outflows to downstream watercourses, unsuitable for cultivation. Such reservoirs are especially common in North America.We consider the practicalities of putting a zebra mussel cultivation system into place and identify gaps in knowledge. We conclude that zebra mussel cultivation offers an attractive tool for managing nutrient-enriched reservoirs, but that the benefits and costs must be balanced on a site-by-site basis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, this may not be the case if there is substantial within-species variation that could influence invasion success. We used a seed addition experiment, comprising 25 taxonomically stratified varieties of three Brassica species introduced to roadside habitats in Canterbury, New Zealand, to quantify variation in performance among species, subspecies and varieties. We aimed to assess if species was the most appropriate taxonomic level at which to evaluate invasion risk. Differences among varieties within species explained approximately 30 times more of the variation in performance (number of individuals/quadrat) than differences among species. Some of the variation among varieties was attributable to differences in seed viability. Nevertheless, differences among taxonomic groups explained only 7\% of the total variation in performance; 28\% was attributable to differences among plots, reflecting broad-scale environmental variation, while 65\% was attributable to differences among quadrats nested within plots, highlighting the importance of fine-scale variation in the availability of suitable microsites. Policy Implications. Our seed addition experiment quantified variation in performance of 25 taxonomically stratified Brassica taxa introduced to roadside habitats. Varieties (nested within species) differed in performance far more than did species. This suggests risk assessments carried out at species level may overlook important subspecific variation in invasion risk. This is particularly true for conventionally bred and genetically modified species, which may contain taxa posing risks different to that at which the species is assessed. Consideration should be given to subjecting unassessed subspecies and varieties of plants to risk assessments similar to those applied to species. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

Variance in spread rates can be driven exogenously by environmental variability or endogenously by demographic or genetic stochasticity in reproduction, survival, and dispersal. Endogenous variability is likely to be important in spread but has not been studied empirically. We show that endogenously generated variance in spread rates is remarkably high between replicated invasions of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in laboratory microcosms. The observed variation between replicate invasions cannot be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, which indicates inherent limitations to predictability in even the simplest ecological settings.}

Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

Using a 20-year time series from Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we show that within MPAs, (1) reef community composition was 21-38\% more stable; (2) the magnitude of disturbance impacts was 30\% lower and (3) subsequent recovery was 20\% faster that in adjacent unprotected habitats. Our results demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of marine communities to natural disturbance possibly through herbivory, trophic cascades and portfolio effects.},

However, these phenomena have rarely been studied for tree species. Euptelea pleiospermum is a relict tree species with a wide distribution in China that offers a novel opportunity to examine such relationships. Here, we measured 13 leaf traits of E. pleiospermum in 20 sites across its natural distribution in China. We investigated the extent of trait variation at local and regional scales, and developed geographic and climate models to explain trait variation at the regional scale. We documented intraspecific trait variation among leaf traits of E. pleiospermum at local and regional scales. Five traits exhibited relatively high trait variation: leaf area, leaf density and three leaf economic traits (leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area [SLA] and leaf phosphorus concentration). Significant trait\textendash geography correlations were mediated by local climate. Most leaf trait variation could be explained (from 24\% to 64\%) by geographic or climate variables, except leaf width, leaf thickness, leaf dry matter content and leaf length\textendash width ratio. Latitude and temperature were the strongest predictors of trait variation throughout the distribution of E. pleiospermum in China, and temperature explained more leaf trait variation than precipitation. In particular, we showed that leaves had longer petiole lengths, higher SLA and lower densities in northern E. pleiospermum populations. We suggest that northern E. pleiospermum populations are adapting to higher latitudinal environments via high growth rate (higher SLA) and low construction investment strategies (lower leaf densities), benefitting northern migration. Overall, we demonstrate that intraspecific trait variation reflects E. pleiospermum response to the local environment. We call for consideration of intraspecific trait variation to examine specific climate response questions. In addition, provenance experiments using widely distributed species are needed to separate trait variation resulting from genetic differentiation and plastic responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2017 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands},

Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-moths\textemdash an insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal links\textemdash at both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50\textendash 3,200 m radius), depending on the species.

  abstract = {Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing - and exclusion - of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known - and not known - about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed - and these must employ better inferential methods - before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

We define coexistence as a fixed point of the community dynamics with no population having zero size. It is demonstrated that the parameter range allowing coexistence shrinks and disappears when the Jacobian of the dynamics decreases to zero. A general notion of regulating factors/variables is introduced. For each population, its impact and sensitivity niches are defined as the differential impact on, and the differential sensitivity towards, the regulating variables, respectively. Either the similarity of the impact niches or the similarity of the sensitivity niches results in a small Jacobian and in a reduced likelihood of coexistence. For the case of a resource continuum, this result reduces to the usual "limited niche overlap" picture for both kinds of niche. As an extension of these ideas to the coexistence of infinitely many species, we demonstrate that Roughgarden's example for coexistence of a continuum of populations is structurally unstable. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The response of plant traits to global change is of fundamental importance to understanding anthropogenic impacts on natural systems. Nevertheless, little is known about plant genetic variation in such responses or the indirect effect of environmental change on higher trophic levels. In a three-year common garden experiment, we grew the shrub Artemisia californica from five populations sourced along a 700 km latitudinal gradient under ambient and nitrogen (N) addition (20 kg N ha-1) and measured plant traits and associated arthropods. N addition increased plant biomass to a similar extent among all populations. In contrast, N addition effects on most other plant traits varied among plant populations; N addition reduced specific leaf area and leaf percent N and increased carbon to nitrogen ratios in the two northern populations, but had the opposite or no effect on the three southern populations. N addition increased arthropod abundance to a similar extent among all populations in parallel with an increase in plant biomass, suggesting that N addition did not alter plant resistance to herbivores. N addition had no effect on arthropod diversity, richness, or evenness. In summary, genetic variation among A. californica populations mediated leaf-trait responses to N addition, but positive direct effects of N addition on plant biomass and indirect effects on arthropod abundance were consistent among all populations. \textcopyright{} 2018 Meza-Lopez et al.

The calculated no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) based on both cell-specific growth rate and two PAM parameters ({$\Phi$} M and {$\Phi$} M ') were mostly identical. Thus, these PAM parameters and cell-specific growth rate were comparable in their sensitivities as the biomarkers for trace metal toxicity to marine phytoplankton. The cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. was the most sensitive species among the four algal species tested because of its higher cell surface to volume ratio. The toxicity of the three tested metals followed the order of Cd {$>$} Cu {$>$} Zn based on the cellular metal concentration of the four algae at the NOEC. The cellular metal bioaccumulation followed the same Freundlich isotherm for each metal regardless of the algal species, indicating that the metal accumulation was a nonmetabolic process under high ambient metal concentrations and that the cell surface metal binding was comparable among the different species. For all the algae examined in our study, the bioaccumulation potentials of Cu and Zn were similar to each other, while the Cd bioaccumulation was much lower under environmentally realistic metal concentration. \textcopyright{} 2005 SETAC.},

We find strong positive relationships between species and functional diversity, and increased functional diversity of fish assemblages coinciding with recovery of species diversity in marine reserves, independent of the method used for classifying species in functional groups. These results indicate that low levels of redundancy in functional species traits exist across a suite of marine systems, and that fishing tends to remove whole functional groups from coastal marine ecosystems. \textcopyright 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Young ({$\leq$} 2+) European catfish and {$\geq$} 1+ perch showed posi-tive selection for tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris, while burbot and pike showed a preference for round goby Neogobius melanostomus, though the values may have been affected by the relatively low sample sizes. We estimate that predators consumed approximately 52 \% of goby biomass over our study stretch each year (burbot 41 \%, {$\leq$} 2+ European catfish 5 \%, pike 3 \%, all other predatory species {$<$} 2 \% each), confirming that gobies rapidly become an important component in the aquatic food web of invaded rivers, both by preying on aquatic invertebrates and as prey to native predators (particularly burbot). On the other hand, our data suggest that the long-term impact on European goby populations, at least in our study area, has been limited, as indicated by their ongoing spread.},

Here, we begin to theoretically unify these diverse empirical findings by showing how a single simple model can generate several different DDRs, depending on the aspect of disturbance that is considered. Additionally, we elucidate the competition-mediated mechanism underlying our results. Our findings have the potential to reconcile apparently conflicting empirical results on the effects of disturbance on diversity.},

Two of the largest canyons in the world, Zhemchug and Pribilof, cut into the edge of the continental shelf in the southeastern Bering Sea. Here currents and upwelling interact to produce a highly productive area, termed the Green Belt, that supports an abundance of fishes and squids as well as birds and marine mammals. We show that in some areas the floor of these canyons harbors high densities of gorgonian and pennatulacean corals and sponges, likely due to enhanced surface productivity, benthic currents and seafloor topography. Rockfishes, including the commercially important Pacific ocean perch, Sebastes alutus, were associated with corals and sponges as well as with isolated boulders. Sculpins, poachers and pleuronectid flounders were also associated with corals in Pribilof Canyon, where corals were most abundant. Fishes likely use corals and sponges as sources of vertical relief, which may harbor prey as well as provide shelter from predators. Boulders may be equivalent habitat in this regard, but are sparse in the canyons, strongly suggesting that biogenic structure is important fish habitat. Evidence of disturbance to the benthos from fishing activities was observed in these remote canyons. Bottom trawling and other benthic fishing gear has been shown to damage corals and sponges that may be very slow to recover from such disturbance. Regulation of these destructive practices is key to conservation of benthic habitats in these canyons and the ecosystem services they provide.},

The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha) became established in Lake St. Clair of the Laurentian Great Lakes in 1986 and spread throughout eastern North America. The second dreissenid, termed the quagga mussel, has been identified as Dreissena bugensis Andrusov, 1897. The quagga occurs in the Dnieper River drainage of Ukraine and now in the lower Great Lakes of North America. In the Dnieper River, populations of D. poly- morpha have been largely replaced by D. bugensis; anecdotal evidence indicates that similar trends may be occurring in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes. Dreissena bugensis occurs as deep as 130 m in the Great Lakes, but in Ukraine is known from only 0-28 m. Dreissena bugensis is more abundant than D. polymorpha in deeper waters in Dneiper River reservoirs. The conclusion that North American quagga mussels have a lower thermal maximum than zebra mussels is not supported by obser- vations made of populations in Ukraine. In the Dnieper River drainage, quagga mussels are less tolerant of salinity than zebra mussels, yet both dreissenids have acclimated to salinities higher than North American pop- ulations; eventual colonization into estuarine and coastal areas of North America cannot be ignored.},

Even holoplanktonic species like ctenophores increase in number in the spring or summer when planktonic food is available in greater abundance. Beyond that basic life cycle-driven seasonal change in numbers, several other kinds of events appear to be increasing the numbers of jellies present in some ecosystems. Over recent decades, man's expanding influence on the oceans has begun to cause real change and there is reason to think that in some regions, new blooms of jellyfish are occurring in response to some of the cumulative effects of these impacts. The issue is not simple and in most cases there are few data to support our perceptions. Some blooms appear to be long-term increases in native jellyfish populations. A different phenomenon is demonstrated by jellyfish whose populations regularly fluctuate, apparently with climate, causing periodic blooms. Perhaps the most damaging type of jellyfish increase in recent decades has been caused by populations of new, nonindigenous species gradually building-up to 'bloom' levels in some regions. Lest one conclude that the next millennium will feature only increases in jellyfish numbers worldwide, examples are also given in which populations are decreasing in heavily impacted coastal areas. Some jellyfish will undoubtedly fall subject to the ongoing species elimination processes that already portend a vast global loss of biodiversity. Knowledge about the ecology of both the medusa and the polyp phases of each life cycle is necessary if we are to understand the true causes of these increases and decreases, but in most cases where changes in medusa populations have been recognized, we know nothing about the field ecology of the polyps.},

At the same time, environmental changes associated with many human activities, such as land use and climate change, have dramatic and often negative impacts on intraspecific variation. We argue for the need for local, regional, and global programs to monitor intraspecific genetic variation. We suggest that such monitoring should include two main strategies: (i) intensive monitoring of multiple types of genetic variation in selected species and (ii) broad-brush modeling for representative species for predicting changes in variation as a function of changes in population size and range extent. Overall, we call for collaborative efforts to initiate the urgently needed monitoring of intraspecific variation.},

Although well studied in terrestrial ecosystems, methanol sources are poorly understood in the marine environment and warrant further investigation. To this end, we adapted a Purge and Trap Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (P\&T-GC/MS) method which allowed reliable measurements of methanol in seawater and marine phytoplankton cultures with a method detection limit of 120 nanomolar. All phytoplankton tested (cyanobacteria: Synechococcus spp. 8102 and 8103, Trichodesmium erythraeum, and Prochlorococcus marinus), and Eukarya (heterokont diatom: Phaeodactylum tricornutum, coccolithophore: Emiliania huxleyi, cryptophyte: Rhodomonas salina, and non-diatom heterokont: Nannochloropsis oculata) produced methanol, ranging from 0.8-13.7 micromolar in culture and methanol per total cellular carbon were measured in the ranges of 0.09-0.3\%. Phytoplankton culture time-course measurements displayed a punctuated production pattern with maxima near early stationary phase. Stabile isotope labeled bicarbonate incorporation experiments confirmed that methanol was produced from phytoplankton biomass. Overall, our findings suggest that phytoplankton are a major source of methanol in the upper water column of the world's oceans.},

A conservation strategy involving the translocation of species to novel ecosystems in anticipation of range shifts forced by climate change, managed relocation (MR) has divided many ecologists and conservationists, mostly because of concerns about the potential invasion risk of the relocated species in their new environments. While this is indeed an important consideration in any evaluation of MR, moving species across the landscape in response to predicted climate shifts also raises a number of larger and important ethical and policy challenges that need to be addressed. These include evaluating the implications of a more aggressive approach to species conservation, assessing MR as a broader ecological policy and philosophy that departs from longstanding scientific and management goals focused on preserving ecological integrity, and considering MR within a more comprehensive ethical and policy response to climate change. Given the complexity and novelty of many of the issues at stake in the MR debate, a more dynamic and pragmatic approach to ethical analysis and debate is needed to help ecologists, conservationists, and environmental decision makers come to grips with MR and the emerging ethical challenges of ecological policy and management under global environmental change.},

Interactions between environmental inputs and expressed phenotypes can be evaluated as ``reaction norms''. Comparisons of these reaction norms among geographically distinct populations may provide evidence for genetic diversity and, moreover, important clues into understanding how the interactions affect evolutionary processes. The water flea Daphnia pulex exhibits predator-induced polyphenism in response to a kairomone released by predatory phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus spp.). The polyphenism, a defensive structure formed on the head that enables juvenile larvae to avoid predation, is referred to as neckteeth. Differences in shape and/or plasticity of defensive structures have also been reported among related Daphnia species, suggesting that the species-specific variation in defensive morphology is derived from intra-specific differences in reaction norms. By determining reaction norms based on the incidence and number of neckteeth, we clarified differences in patterns of neckteeth formation in response to varying concentrations of Chaoborus kairomone. We then compared these differences among populations (strains) collected from six locations in Japan. Our findings showed that the reaction norms of both traits differed among strains. Furthermore, a molecular phylogeny using mitochondrial ND5 and COI sequences suggested that differences in the reaction norms of Japanese strains corresponded to their genetically different lineages, which likely originated from North American populations that were probably introduced to Japan independently. \textcopyright{} 2015, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

The authors discuss how population- and community-level responses to toxicants under GCC are likely to be influenced by various ecological mechanisms. Stress due to GCC may reduce the potential for resistance to and recovery from toxicant exposure. Long-term toxicant exposure can result in acquired tolerance to this stressor at the population or community level, but an associated cost of tolerance may be the reduced potential for tolerance to subsequent climatic stress (or vice versa). Moreover, GCC can induce large-scale shifts in community composition, which may affect the vulnerability of communities to other stressors. Ecological modeling based on species traits (representing life-history traits, population vulnerability, sensitivity to toxicants, and sensitivity to climate change) can be a promising approach for predicting combined impacts of GCC and toxicants on populations and communities. 2012 SETAC.},

Under funding from NOAA and NASA, we developed a time series observatory to understand the seasonal variability of Synechococcus and other phytoplankton. Our goal is to understand the distribution and relative contribution of Synechococcus to the carbon cycle and how they relate to nutrients and temperature. Synechococcus in the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight exhibited a clear seasonal abundance pattern in both inshore and offshore waters-peaking in abundance (11??10 4cellsml -1) during warm periods of summer. Synechococci were numerically important during periods of stratification when waters were warm and macronutrients were low. Using a simple algorithm to convert cellular volume to cellular carbon using image analysis, we estimated that Synechococcus cellular carbon ranged from 0.1 to 1.5pg C per cell and was most significant compared to total particulate carbon in the summer peaking at {$\sim$}25\% of the total carbon available. No direct correlations were found between Synechococcus abundance and nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate. However, inshore Synechococcus abundance peaked at 10 4 cellsml -1 when nitrogen concentrations were lowest. Our results suggest that Synechococcus is adapted to warm temperatures and are capable of demonstrating rapid growth during summer when macronutrients are limiting. The ability of Synechococcus to take advantage of high summer temperatures, low nutrient concentrations and low light levels allows them to maintain a picoplankton community during periods of low detritus and nanophytoplankton is nutrient limited. Temperature-dependence is important in altering the size spectrum of the phytoplankton community and affects the carbon cycle on the Mid Atlantic Bight. ?? 2010.},

  abstract = {Marine microorganisms constitute the largest percentage of living biomass and serve as the major driving force behind nutrient and energy cycles. While viruses only comprise a small percentage of this biomass (i.e. 5\%), they dominate in numerical abundance and genetic diversity. Through host infection and mortality, viruses affect microbial population dynamics, community composition, genetic evolution and biogeochemical cycling. However, the field of marine viral ecology is currently limited by a lack of data regarding how different environmental factors regulate virus dynamics and host-virus interactions. The goal of the present mini-review is to contribute to the evolution of marine viral ecology, through the assimilation of available data regarding the manner and degree to which environmental factors affect viral decay and infectivity as well as influence latent period and production. Considering the ecological importance of viruses in the marine ecosystem and the increasing pressure from anthropogenic activity and global climate change on marine systems, a synthesis of existing information provides a timely framework for future research initiatives in viral ecology.

  abstract = {Viral lysis of phytoplankton constrains marine primary production, food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean. Yet, little is known about the biogeographical distribution of viral lysis rates across the global ocean. To address this, we investigated phytoplankton group-specific viral lysis rates along a latitudinal gradient within the North Atlantic Ocean. The data show large-scale distribution patterns of different virus groups across the North Atlantic that are associated with the biogeographical distributions of their potential microbial hosts. Average virus-mediated lysis rates of the picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were lower than those of the picoeukaryotic and nanoeukaryotic phytoplankton (that is, 0.14 per day compared with 0.19 and 0.23 per day, respectively). Total phytoplankton mortality (virus plus grazer-mediated) was comparable to the gross growth rate, demonstrating high turnover rates of phytoplankton populations. Virus-induced mortality was an important loss process at low and mid latitudes, whereas phytoplankton mortality was dominated by microzooplankton grazing at higher latitudes (\textquestiondown 56\textdegree N). This shift from a viral-lysis-dominated to a grazing-dominated phytoplankton community was associated with a decrease in temperature and salinity, and the decrease in viral lysis rates was also associated with increased vertical mixing at higher latitudes. Ocean-climate models predict that surface warming will lead to an expansion of the stratified and oligotrophic regions of the world's oceans. Our findings suggest that these future shifts in the regional climate of the ocean surface layer are likely to increase the contribution of viral lysis to phytoplankton mortality in the higher-latitude waters of the North Atlantic, which may potentially reduce transfer of matter and energy up the food chain and thus affect the capacity of the northern North Atlantic to act as a long-term sink for CO2.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 11 August 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.130.},

The size distribution of forest species showed a continuous normal or log-normal distribution, with many canopy species and a few large species, and varied from community to community. Multiple regression showed that this variation is related to rainfall and to disturbance. 4. Size distributions in wet forests were less skewed than those in dry forests, with a smaller proportion of big species and a smaller size range. At the same time they exhibited tighter species packing, resulting in higher species richness. Communities with high disturbance have less species packing and lower species richness. 5. Synthesis . We conclude that the factors that constrain organism size and species coexistence in these tropical forest tree communities differ from those known to operate on a number of well- studied animal communities.},

Little is known about the O. marina life cycle; it is even unknown if cells are haploid, diploid or polyploid, although there is one report that sex occurs by homothallic isogamy. There is considerable information on the cell cycle, which we briefly review and provide a guide to the literature for details.

Comparatively, however, it remains unclear how ecosystems recover after disturbances. In this perspective, I contend that ecological restoration should advance toward a general, dynamic theory that describes the recovery rates and trajectories of ecosystems along restoration. This approach should address three fundamental challenges corresponding to three components of ecological systems: complexity (how do we quantify ecological restoration?), space (what are the spatial scales of restoration?), and global change (how does global change determine restoration's reference states?). A generic model and experiment based on metacommunities is used to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Given the extent of ecosystem degradation and the international consensus to restore ecosystems, revealing the patterns and mechanisms underlying recovery is a fundamental and timely issue toward a general theory of ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {Ensuring stable food supplies is a major challenge for the 21st century. There is consensus that increased food production is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve food security, and that agriculture should also aim at stabilizing crop production over time. In this context, biodiversity-based approaches to food security are increasingly being supported based on the fact that biodiversity can increase and stabilize crop production. However, agricultural systems are often highly fragmented and our current understanding of how such fragmentation affects biodiversity and food production remains incomplete, thus limiting our capacity to manage agricultural landscapes for food security. We developed a spatially explicit model of crop dynamics to investigate how the fragmentation of natural habitats for agricultural conversion impacts food production and food security, with a focus on animal-dependent crop production. Fragmentation produces a variety of spatial and biodiversity-mediated effects that affect both the mean and stability (temporal invariability) of animal-dependent crop production. Fragmentation has a dual effect on animal-dependent production. On the one hand, spatial aggregation of natural land decreases animal-dependent production by reducing the Landscape Pollination Potential, a metric that captures fragmentation and pollinator spillover effects within the agricultural landscape. But aggregation increases animal-dependent production by maintaining a higher pollinator diversity in larger fragments of natural habitat. The net effects of fragmentation on animal-dependent crop production depend on the land-use change pattern, the strength of the pollinator spillover to crop land and the animal pollination dependence of crops. Synthesis. Our study sheds new light in the food security debate by showing that high and stable crop production depends on biodiversity and the spatial fragmentation of agricultural landscapes, and by revealing the ecological mechanisms of food security in crop pollination systems. Management for food security should consider factors such as pollinators' spillover, the amount and spatial aggregation of semi-natural habitat and the animal pollination dependence of crops. This information would be useful to design agricultural landscapes for high Landscape Pollination Potential. These results are highly relevant in the global change context, and given the worldwide trends in agriculture, which shifts towards more animal-dependent crop production.},

In the Atlantic Ocean, these 2 picoplankters exhibit different spatial and seasonal distributions. In order to better understand the ecology of these species, we measured growth and photoacclimation responses including fluorescence excitation [F*ph({$\lambda$})] and in vivo absorption [a*ph({$\lambda$})] spectra over a range of growth irradiances for P. marinus (clone SS120) and Synechococcus WH8103, both isolated from the Sargasso Sea. To explore the physiological diversity of P. marinus, we measured the physiological responses of another P. marinus clone, MED4, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate as a function of temperature was also examined for all 3 clones. P. marinus SS120 and Synechococcus WH8103 have different temperature optima for growth, but these do not explain the different latitudinal distributions in the North Atlantic. P. marinus SSI20 is adapted for growth at low light intensities relative to Synechococcus WH8103, which is consistent with the relative depth distribution of P. marinus and Synechococcus in the field. The light-dependent growth response of P. marinus MED4 is more similar to Synechococcus WH8103 than to P. marinus SS120. The unique pigment content of P. marinus (which contain divinyl chlorophylls a and b) results in maximal absorbance in the blue wavelengths. The high total chl b/chl a ratio of P. marinus SS120 enables it to absorb more light, grow faster than Synechococcus WH8103 (and P. marinus MED4) at low light intensities, and presumably to outcompete Synechococcus in the deep euphotic zone. At high growth irradiances, P. marinus SS120 contains measureable amounts of normal (monovinyl) chl b, whereas this pigment was not found in P. marinus MED4 at any growth irradiance. Photoacclimative changes in pigment ratios, and not package effect, account for most of the changes in a*ph({$\lambda$}) and F*ph({$\lambda$}) with light intensity for all 3 picoplankters. At high light intensities, zeaxanthin contributes substantially to a*ph({$\lambda$}) in the blue, but appears to transfer little or no excitation energy to the reaction centers, based on F*ph({$\lambda$}) measurements. For P. marinus, high absorption in the blue due to divinyl chl a and b relative to normal chl a and b, absorption due to zeaxanthin, and small cell size result in unusually high a*ph (blue) relative to a*ph (red).},

Photosynthetic microbes, collectively termed phytoplankton, are responsible for the vast majority of primary production in marine waters. The availability of nutrients in the upper ocean frequently limits the activity and abundance of these organisms. Experimental data have revealed two broad regimes of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the modern upper ocean. Nitrogen availability tends to limit productivity throughout much of the surface low-latitude ocean, where the supply of nutrients from the subsurface is relatively slow. In contrast, iron often limits productivity where subsurface nutrient supply is enhanced, including within the main oceanic upwelling regions of the Southern Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific. Phosphorus, vitamins and micronutrients other than iron may also (co-)limit marine phytoplankton. The spatial patterns and importance of co-limitation, however, remain unclear. Variability in the stoichiometries of nutrient supply and biological demand are key determinants of oceanic nutrient limitation. Deciphering the mechanisms that underpin this variability, and the consequences for marine microbes, will be a challenge. But such knowledge will be crucial for accurately predicting the consequences of ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.},

Temporal dynamics of food web structure are central to our understanding of energy and nutrient fluxes in changing environments, but little is known about how evolutionary processes shape trophic position variation in natural populations. We propose that trophic position, whose expression depends on both environmental and genetic determinants of the diet variation in individual consumers, is a quantitative trait that can evolve via natural selection. Such evolution can occur either when trophic position is correlated with other heritable morphological and behavioural traits under selection, or when trophic position is a target of selection, which is possible if the fitness effects of prey items are heterogeneously distributed along food chains. Recognising trophic position as an evolving trait, whose expression depends on the food web context, provides an important conceptual link between behavioural foraging theory and food web dynamics, and a useful starting point for the integration of ecological and evolutionary studies of trophic position.},

Despite local successes of well-designed and well-managed protected areas proving effective in stemming biodiversity loss, there are significant shortcomings in the usual process of implementation of protected areas that preclude relying on them as a global solution to this problem. The shortcomings include technical problems associated with large gaps in the coverage of critical ecological processes related to individual home ranges and propagule dispersal, and the overall failure of such areas to protect against the broad range of threats affecting ecosystems. Practical issues include budget constraints, conflicts with human development, and a growing human population that will increase not only the extent of anthropogenic stressors but the difficulty in successfully enforcing protected areas.

This review discusses sources and patterns of intraspecific trait variation and their consequences for understanding how ecological processes and patterns will respond to global change. We examine how current ecological models and theories incorporate intraspecific variation, review existing data sources that could help parameterize models that account for intraspecific variation in global change predictions, and discuss new data that may be needed. We provide guidelines on when it is most important to consider intraspecific variation, such as when trait variation is heritable or when nonlinear relationships are involved. We also highlight benefits and limitations of different model types and argue that many common modeling approaches such as matrix population models or global dynamic vegetation models can allow a stronger consideration of intraspecific trait variation if the necessary data are available. We recommend that existing data need to be made more accessible, though in some cases, new experiments are needed to disentangle causes of variation.},

This general cognitive process has been shown to play a role in a wide diversity of behaviours, including interactions with predators, prey, rivals and mates. Learning is thus expected to be essential for survival and reproduction in many species, but because of associated costs, it is also predicted to be fine-tuned to prevailing conditions by selective processes. Considering the importance of learning in determining populations' response to environmental changes as well as potential impacts on evolutionary rates, there is still a paucity of evolutionary studies on learning, especially in natural populations. Here I review recent progress in our understanding of the evolutionary causes and consequences of intra-specific variation in associative learning abilities in wild populations, and discuss areas for further investigation. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social\textendash ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment. Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

Prochlorococcus grows robustly at low cell concentrations, in liquid or on solid medium, when cocultured with marine heterotrophic bacteria. Once the Prochlorococcus cell concentration surpasses a critical threshold, the "helper" heterotrophs can be eliminated with antibiotics to produce axenic cultures.

We address this knowledge gap by testing the ability of three contrasting null models to predict the joint impacts of warming and a range of other aquatic stressors using a new database of 296 experimental combinations. Despite concerns that stressors will interact to cause synergisms, we found that net impacts were usually best explained by the effect of the stronger stressor alone (the dominance null model), especially if this stressor was a local disturbance associated with human land use. Prediction accuracy depended on stressor identity and how asymmetric stressors were in the magnitude of their effects. These findings suggest we can effectively predict the impacts of multiple stressors by focusing on the stronger stressor, as habitat alteration, nutrients and contamination often override the biological consequences of higher temperatures in freshwater ecosystems.},

However, its application requires strong assumptions to be made about the causation of fitness variation. In its univariate form, the breeder's equation assumes that the trait of interest is not correlated with other traits having causal effects on fitness. In its multivariate form, the validity of predicted change rests on the assumption that all such correlated traits have been measured and incorporated into the analysis. Here, we (i) highlight why these assumptions are likely to be seriously violated in studies of natural, rather than artificial, selection and (ii) advocate wider use of the Robertson\textendash Price identity as a more robust, and less assumption-laden, alternative to the breeder's equation for applications in evolutionary ecology.},

  abstract = {Our current knowledge on the microbial component of zooplankton diet is limited, and it is generally assumed that bacteria-sized prey is not directly consumed by most mesozooplankton grazers in the marine food webs. We questioned this assumption and conducted field and laboratory studies to examine picocyanobacteria contribution to the diets of Baltic Sea zooplankton, including copepods. First, qPCR targeting ITS-1 rDNA sequence of the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. was used to examine picocyanobacterial DNA occurrence in the guts of Baltic zooplankton (copepods, cladocerans and rotifers). All field-collected zooplankton were found to consume picocyanobacteria in substantial quantities. In terms of Synechococcus quantity, the individual gut content was highest in cladocerans, whereas biomass-specific gut content was highest in rotifers and copepod nauplii. Moreover, the gut content in copepods was positively related to the picocyanobacteria abundance and negatively to the total phytoplankton abundance in the water column at the time of sampling. This indicates that increased availability of picocyanobacteria resulted in the increased intake of this prey and that copepods may rely more on picoplankton when food in the preferred size range declines. Second, a feeding experiments with a laboratory reared copepod Acartia tonsa fed a mixture of the picocyanobacterium Synechococcus bacillaris and microalga Rhodomonas salina confirmed that copepods ingested Synechococcus, even when the alternative food was plentiful. Finally, palatability of the picocyanobacteria for A. tonsa was demonstrated using uptake of (13)C by the copepods as a proxy for carbon uptake in feeding experiment with (13)C-labeled S. bacillaris. These findings suggest that, if abundant, picoplankton may become an important component of mesozooplankton diet, which needs to be accounted for in food web models and productivity assessments.},

In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution.},

Hence, we urgently need to examine the implications of biodiversity loss not only in terms of species conservation but also in terms of sustainability of ecosystem services. The ability of protected areas to maintain local species richness has been clearly demonstrated. However, preserving goods and services provided by ecosystems requires not only the conservation of species richness but also the conservation of the most 'original' species, i.e. the ones with the highest average rarity of their attributes which are likely to perform some unique functions in ecosystems. We proposed a new conservation of biological originality (CBO) index as well as associated randomization tests to quantify the ability of protected areas to maintain viable populations for the most original species. As an application, we used long-term fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR) to determine the species which benefited from the protection reinforcement in 1999. We also estimated a set of 14 ecomorphological functional traits on the 37 fish species caught in the BSNR and we obtained a functional originality value for each species. As a result, we found that functional originality was significantly protected in the fish assemblage of the BSNR: species with the most original functional trait combinations became more abundant after 1999. Our finding suggests that protecting most original species is an insurance against functional diversity erosion in the BSNR. More generally, our new index can be used to test whether protected areas may protect preferentially the most original species and whether restorative management promotes the reestablishment of the most original species with particular habitat requirements. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Mixed effects models were used with alien species presences in 8.25 \texttimes{} 8.25 km cells as dependent variable and the percentage of protected area, as well as the agricultural and artificial land cover types richness (as indicators of human presence) as independent variables. In addition, the spatial cross-correlation between the percentage of protected area and alien species richness was examined across scales. Results indicated that the percentage of protected area per cell is a poor predictor of alien species richness. Spatial analysis indicated that cells with higher percentage of protected areas have slightly less alien species than cells with lower percentage of protected areas. This result is likely to be driven by the overall negative correlation between habitat protection and anthropogenic activities. Thus, the conclusions deduced by data deriving from protected areas are likely to hold true for patterns of alien species in non-protected areas when the human pressures are accounted for.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models have often been developed based on ecological data. To develop reliable data-driven models, however, a sound model training and evaluation procedures are needed. A crucial step in these procedures is the assessment of the model performance, with as key component the applied performance criterion. Therefore, we reviewed seven performance criteria commonly applied in presence-absence modelling (the correctly classified instances, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, the normalised mutual information statistic, the true skill statistic and the odds ratio) and analysed their application in both the model training and evaluation process. Although estimates of predictive performance have been used widely to assess final model quality, a systematic overview was missing because most analyses of performance criteria have been empirical and only focused on specific aspects of the performance criteria. This paper provides such an overview showing that different performance criteria evaluate a model differently and that this difference may be explained by the dependency of these criteria on the prevalence of the validation set. We showed theoretically that these prevalence effects only occur if the data are inseparable by an n-dimensional hyperplane, n being the number of input variables. Given this inseparability, different performance criteria focus on different aspects of model performance during model training, such as sensitivity, specificity or predictive accuracy. These findings have important consequences for ecological modelling because ecological data are mostly inseparable due to data noise and the complexity of the studied system. Consequently, it should be very clear which aspect of the model performance is evaluated, and models should be evaluated consistently, that is, independent of, or taking into account, species prevalence. The practical implications of these findings are clear. They provide further insight into the evaluation of ecological presence/absence models and attempt to assist modellers in their choice of suitable performance criteria. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Like other tropical or temperate framework builders, these systems are facing an uncertain future due to several threats, such as global warming and ocean acidification. In the case of Mediterranean CWC communities, the effectmay be exacerbated due to the greater capacity of thesewaters to absorb atmosphericCO2 compared to the global ocean. Calcification in these organisms is an energy-demanding process, and it is expected that energy requirements will be greater as seawater pH and the avail- ability of carbonate ions decrease. Therefore, studies assess- ing the effect of a pH decrease in skeletal growth, and metabolic balance are critical to fully understand the potential responses of these organisms under a changing scenario. In this context, the presentwork aimsto investigate themedium- to long-term effect of a low pH scenario on calcification and the biochemical composition of two CWCs from the Medi- terranean, Dendrophyllia cornigera and Desmophyllum dianthus. After 314 d of exposure to acidified conditions, a significant decrease of 70 \%was observed in Desmophyllum dianthus skeletal growth rate,while Dendrophyllia cornigera showed no differences between treatments. Instead, only subtle differences between treatments were observed in the organicmatter amount, lipid content, skeletalmicrodensity, or porosity in both species, although due to the high variability of the results, these differenceswere not statistically significant. Our results also confirmed a heterogeneous effect of low pH onthe skeletalgrowthrateof theorganismsdependingontheir initial weight, suggesting that those specimens with high calcification ratesmay be themost susceptible to the negative effects of acidification.},

The only previous whole-transcriptome study (Moya et al. Molecular Ecology, 2012; 21, 2440) documented extensive disruption of gene expression, particularly of genes encoding skeletal organic matrix proteins, in juvenile corals (Acropora millepora) after short-term (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO2 . In this study, whole-transcriptome analysis was used to compare the effects of such 'acute' (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO2 with a longer ('prolonged'; 9 d) period of exposure beginning immediately post-fertilization. Far fewer genes were differentially expressed under the 9-d treatment, and although the transcriptome data implied wholesale disruption of metabolism and calcification genes in the acute treatment experiment, expression of most genes was at control levels after prolonged treatment. There was little overlap between the genes responding to the acute and prolonged treatments, but heat shock proteins (HSPs) and heat shock factors (HSFs) were over-represented amongst the genes responding to both treatments. Amongst these was an HSP70 gene previously shown to be involved in acclimation to thermal stress in a field population of another acroporid coral. The most obvious feature of the molecular response in the 9-d treatment experiment was the upregulation of five distinct Bcl-2 family members, the majority predicted to be anti-apoptotic. This suggests that an important component of the longer term response to elevated CO2 is suppression of apoptosis. It therefore appears that juvenile A. millepora have the capacity to rapidly acclimate to elevated pCO2 , a process mediated by upregulation of specific HSPs and a suite of Bcl-2 family members.},

  abstract = {Coral-excavating sponges are the most important bioeroders on Caribbean reefs and increase in abundance throughout the region. This increase is commonly attributed to a concomitant increase in food availability due to eutrophication and pollution. We therefore investigated the uptake of organic matter by the two coral-excavating sponges Siphonodictyon sp. and Cliona delitrix and tested whether they are capable of consuming dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as part of their diet. A device for simultaneous sampling of water inhaled and exhaled by the sponges was used to directly measure the removal of DOC and bacteria in situ. During a single passage through their filtration system 14\% and 13\% respectively of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the inhaled water was removed by the sponges. 82\% (Siphonodictyon sp.; mean {$\pm$} SD; 13 {$\pm$} 17 {$\mu$}mol L(-1)) and 76\% (C. delitrix; 10 {$\pm$} 12 {$\mu$}mol L(-1)) of the carbon removed was taken up in form of DOC, whereas the remainder was taken up in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC; bacteria and phytoplankton) despite high bacteria retention efficiency (72 {$\pm$} 15\% and 87 {$\pm$} 10\%). Siphonodictyon sp. and C. delitrix removed DOC at a rate of 461 {$\pm$} 773 and 354 {$\pm$} 562 {$\mu$}mol C h(-1) respectively. Bacteria removal was 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.9 \texttimes{} 10(10) and 1.7 {$\pm$} 0.6 \texttimes{} 10(10) cells h(-1), which equals a carbon uptake of 46.0 {$\pm$} 21.2 and 42.5 {$\pm$} 14.0 {$\mu$}mol C h(-1) respectively. Therefore, DOC represents 83 and 81\% of the TOC taken up by Siphonodictyon sp. and C. delitrix per hour. These findings suggest that similar to various reef sponges coral-excavating sponges also mainly rely on DOC to meet their carbon demand. We hypothesize that excavating sponges may also benefit from an increasing production of more labile algal-derived DOC (as compared to coral-derived DOC) on reefs as a result of the ongoing coral-algal phase shift.},

  abstract = {(228 words) The ecological models of Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra have had an enormous impact on ecology over the past century. Some of the earliest-and clearest-experimental tests of these models were famously conducted by Georgy Gause in the 1930's. Although well known, the data from these experiments are not widely available, and are often difficult to analyze using standard statistical and computational tools. Here, we introduce the gauseR package, a collection of tools for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time series data of one or more species. The package includes several methods for parameter estimation and optimization, and includes several example datasets from Gause's experiments. The package is available for download at github.com/adamtclark/gauseR. To demonstrate the package, we apply it to several classic experimental studies from Gause, as well as two other well-known datasets on multi-trophic dynamics on Isle Royale, and in spatially structured mite populations. In almost all cases, models fit observations closely, and fitted parameter values make ecological sense. Taken together, we hope that the methods, data, and analyses that we present here provide a simple and user-friendly way to interact with complex ecological data. We are optimistic that these methods will be especially useful to students and educators who are studying ecological dynamics, as well as researchers who would like a fast tool for basic analyses. Introduction A century ago, Alfred J. Lotka (1920, 1925) and Vito Volterra (1926) published their canonical works concerning the mathematics of species interactions. These theories were among the first to suggest that the dynamics of complex ecological systems could be described through simple underlying equations (Giorgio 1988). Inspired by the possibility of understanding natural systems through mathematics, Georgy Gause stated in his "Struggle for Existence" (1934b):},

Sponges bear evolutionary and ecological importance with limited information on their immunological attribute and adaptational resilience in a changing environment. This paper reports temperature and pH specific responses of immune related parameters in sponge maintained in the experimental conditions of laboratory. Innate immunological parameters like phagocytosis and generation of cytotoxic molecules like superoxide anion, nitric oxide and phenoloxidase activity were estimated in E. carteri at different environmentally realistic water temperatures (10, 20, 30 and 40 \textdegree C) and pH (6.4, 7.4 and 8.4). Phagocytosis and cytotoxicity are established as important immune parameters of invertebrates. Calalase, an antioxidant enzyme and phosphatases are involved in pathogen destruction and are considered as components of innate immunity. Activities of catalase, acid and alkaline phosphatases were estimated in E. carteri at different thermal regimes and pH. Modulation of phagocytic and cytotoxic responses and the activities of catalase and phosphatases at different water temperatures and pH indicated temperature and pH specific immunological status of E. carteri. Present investigation deals with the effects of selected hydrological parameters on the fundamental immune related parameters in sponge indicating its adaptational plasticity. Immunological resilience of this species in the face of variation of water temperature and pH is thought to be a special adaptive feature of sponge, a reported "living fossil".},

To account for the toxication effect of the allelopathic phytoplankton, a type-IV functional response is used to model zooplankton grazing. The main aim of the study is to analyze the role, zooplankton grazing plays, in determining the dynamics of the system. Stability and bifurcation behavior of the different equilibrium points of the ODE model is studied. It has been observed that under certain parameter restrictions, extinction of one or both plankton population can occur. The model system is seen to exhibit oscillatory behavior around the equilibrium point of co-existence for a critical value of zooplankton grazing rate. A spatial extension of the model is considered and analyzed for diffusion-driven instability as well as stability. For the diffusive model also, it is found that diffusion-driven instability takes place when the grazing rate of zooplankton lies within an interval. The analysis also revealed that for sufficiently low diffusivity of phytoplankton and high value of half-saturation constant in zooplankton predation function, the diffusive system exhibit asymptotically stable behavior which signifies disappearance of the phenomenon of bloom formation for the diffusive model. Cross-diffusion of zooplankton under the influence of allelopathic phytoplankton is incorporated into the spatial model. Using matrix stability approach, the cross-diffusive model is analyzed and criteria for Turing bifurcation derived. Numerical simulations are performed to justify analytical findings. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In these global relationships, the half-saturation constant Km, i.e. the resource availability at which half of the maximum intake is reached, determines the outcome of models and may contribute to explain behavioral traits, life-strategies and species occurrence. As macroecological data on this parameter are rather scarce, our investigation aims (1) to provide an overview of the half-saturation constants reported in literature and (2) to explore the consistency of the data with the body size trait. First, a meta-analysis was conducted on reviews and original studies published in literature. Second, the half-saturation constants obtained for several groups were linked to body size. In total, 338 half-saturation constants were collected from bacteria to ungulates, showing that the half-saturation reflects less than expected body size. Individual body size is not the dominant predictor determining the half-saturation constant, in contrast to interacting resource and consumer's sizes which are crucial to understand the variability of functional responses.},

Here, we use a quantitative genetics approach to investigate the coevolution of multiple quantitative traits under selection, mutation, and limited dispersal. We track the dynamics of trait means and of variance\textendash covariances between traits that experience frequency-dependent selection. Assuming a multivariate-normal trait distribution, we recover classical dynamics of quantitative genetics, as well as stability and evolutionary branching conditions of invasion analyses, except that due to limited dispersal, selection depends on indirect fitness effects and relatedness. In particular, correlational selection that associates different traits within-individuals depends on the fitness effects of such associations between-individuals. We find that these kin selection effects can be as relevant as pleiotropy for the evolution of correlation between traits. We illustrate this with an example of the coevolution of two social traits whose association within-individuals is costly but synergistically beneficial between-individuals. As dispersal becomes limited and relatedness increases, associations between-traits between-individuals become increasingly targeted by correlational selection. Consequently, the trait distribution goes from being bimodal with a negative correlation under panmixia to unimodal with a positive correlation under limited dispersal.},

In recent years, genetic intervention of life span regulating pathways, for example, in Drosophila as well as case studies in non-classical animal models, have provided compelling evidence to challenge these views. 2. Rather than comprehensively revisiting studies on the established genetic model systems of ageing, we here focus on an alternative model organism with a wild type (unselected genotype) characterized by a unique diversity in longevity - the honey bee. 3. Honey bee (Apis mellifera) life span varies from a few weeks to more than 2 years. This plasticity is largely controlled by environmental factors. Thereby, although individuals are closely related genetically, distinct life histories can emerge as a function of social environmental change. 4. Another remarkable feature of the honey bee is the occurrence of reverted behavioural ontogeny in the worker (female helper) caste. This behavioural peculiarity is associated with alterations in somatic maintenance functions that are indicative of reverted senescence. Thus, although intraspecific variation in organismal life span is not uncommon, the honey bee holds great promise for gaining insights into regulatory pathways that can shape the time-course of ageing by delaying, halting or even reversing processes of senescence. These aspects provide the setting of our review. 5. We will highlight comparative findings from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans in particular, and focus on knowledge spanning from molecular- to behavioural-senescence to elucidate how the honey bee can contribute to novel insights into regulatory mechanisms that underlie plasticity and robustness or irreversibility in ageing. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

We exposed both species to cues from three important North American predators: round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), which is native in the ancestral range of the mussels, and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) and rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) that are native in North America. 3. Both mussel species responded to risk cues by increasing shell thickness and decreasing growth rates. The response to round goby was smaller than the response to the two new predators. 4. The strength of the induced response was negatively correlated with growth in both mussel species and both the strength of the induced defence and the decrease in growth were larger for zebra mussels than for quagga mussels. Survival was higher in zebra mussels than in quagga mussels, but there was no significant difference in survival among different risk cue treatments. 5. The lower response and correlated faster growth of quagga mussels than zebra mussels in response to risk cues may be an additional reason for the replacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels in North America, at least as long as native predators are not a major source of mortality. If true, we predict that both mussel species will co-occur after the exotic round goby becomes a dominant mussel predator in North America.},

The model accounts for the prey's interspecies competition and therefore is asymptotically stable, whereas its oscillatory behavior is induced by temporal variations in environmental conditions simulated by those in the prey's reproduction rate. Two models of the variations are considered, each of them combining randomness with ``hidden'' periodicity. The stationary joint probability density function (PDF) of the number of predators and prey is calculated numerically by the path integration (PI) method based on the use of characteristic functions and the fast Fourier transform. The numerical results match those for the asymptotic case of white-noise variations for which an analytical solution is available. Several examples are studied, with calculations of important characteristics of oscillations, for example the expected rate of up-crossings given the level of the predator number. The calculated PDFs may be of predominantly random (unimodal) or predominantly periodic nature (bimodal). Thus, the PI method has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for studies of the dynamics of predator-prey pairs. The method captures the random oscillations as observed in nature, taking into account potential periodicity in the environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

On the other hand, total dreissenid density increased from 173 to 8816 m(-2), and total biomass increased from 0.4 to 28.6 g DW m(-2). Over this 10-year time period, D. r. bugensis displaced D. polymorpha as the dominant dreissenid, comprising 97.7\% of the total population in 2005. In 2007, Diporeia was rarely found at depths shallower than 90 m and continued to decline at greater depths, whereas densities of D. r. bugensis continued to increase at depths greater than 50 m. 3. The decline in Diporeia occurred progressively from shallow to deep regions, and was temporally coincident with the expansion of D. polymorpha in nearshore waters followed by the expansion of D. r. bugensis in offshore waters. In addition, Diporeia density was negatively related to dreissenid density within and across depth intervals; the latter result indicated that dreissenids in shallow waters remotely influenced Diporeia in deep waters. 4. With the loss of Diporeia and increase in D. r. bugensis, the benthic community has become a major energy sink rather that a pathway to upper trophic levels. With this replacement of dominant taxa, we estimate that the relative benthic energy pool increased from 17 to 109 kcal m(-2) between 1994/1995 and 2005, and to 342 kcal m(-2) by 2007. We project that previously observed impacts on fish populations will continue and become more pronounced as the D. r. bugensis population continues to expand in deeper waters.},

  abstract = {Fractal measurements of animal movement paths have been used to analyze how animals view habitats at dif- ferent spatial scales. One problem has been the absence of error estimates for fractal d estimators. To address this weakness, I present and test 4 new estimators for measuring fractal dimension at different spatial scales, along with estimates of their variation. The estimators are based on dividing the movement path into pairs of steps, forming V's, and then estimating various statistics from each V. I measured the performance of these estimators by comparing them to the traditional divider d method, using data generated by two different animal movement models. The estimator based on the net distance between the two steps and the cos turning angle was most accurate, giving estimates similar to those of the traditionally-used divider d method. Precision increased with longer and straighter paths. Strengths of this new estimator are that it can estimate fractal d at different spatial scales, give an estimate of variation, and combine data from many separate path segments which have been gathered at various spatial scales.}

The hierarchical nature of habitat causes movement path structure to vary with spatial scale, and the patchy nature of habitat causes movement path structure to vary throughout space. These responses can be measured by a combination of path tortuousity (measured with fractal dimension) versus spatial scale, the variation in tortuousity of small path segments along the movement path, and the correlation between tortuousities of adjacent path segments. These statistics were tested using simulated animal movements. When movement paths contained no spatial heterogeneity, then fractal D and variance continuously increased with scale, and correlation was zero at all scales. When movement paths contained spatial heterogeneity, then fractal D sometimes showed a discontinuity at transitions between domains of scale, variation showed peaks at transitions, and correlations showed a statistically significant positive value at scales smaller than patch size, decreasing to below zero at scales greater than patch size. I illustrated these techniques with movement paths from deer mice and red-backed voles. These new analyses should help understand how animals perceive and react to their landscape structure at various spatial scales, and to answer questions about how habitat structure affects animal movement patterns.},

The coral Acropora millepora was 3- to 10-fold more sensitive to the three herbicides than the CCA Neogoniolithon fosliei. While the photosynthesis of CCA was not affected by the herbicide concentrations used ({$<$} 1 {$\mu$}g L-1), temperatures of 31\textdegree C and 32\textdegree C alone significantly inhibited photosynthetic efficiency ({$\Delta$}F:F'm) and caused chronic photoinhibition (reduced Fv : Fm) and substantial bleaching. Environmentally relevant concentrations of each herbicide increased the negative effects of thermal stress on coral at 31\textdegree C and 32\textdegree C. Mixed model analyses of variance showed that the effects of elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) and herbicide on photosynthetic efficiency of coral symbionts were additive. Furthermore, the effect of either diuron or atrazine in combination with higher SST (31\textdegree C and 32\textdegree C) on chronic photoinhibition was distinctly greater than additive (synergistic). Reducing the herbicide concentration by 1 {$\mu$}g L-1 diuron above 30\textdegree C would protect photosynthetic efficiency by the equivalent of 1.8\textdegree C and reduce chronic photoinhibition by the equivalent of a 1\textdegree C reduction. Reduced water quality increases the vulnerability of corals to elevated SSTs, and effective management of local water quality can reduce negative effects of global stressors such as elevated SST. \textcopyright{} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

  abstract = {1. Streams collect runoff, heat, and sediment from their watersheds, making them highly vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances such as urbanization and climate change. Forecasting the effects of these disturbances using process-based models is critical to identifying the form and magnitude of likely impacts. Here, we integrate a new biotic model with four previously developed physical models (downscaled climate projections, stream hydrology, geomorphology, and water temperature) to predict how stream fish growth and reproduction will most probably respond to shifts in climate and urbanization over the next several decades. 2. The biotic submodel couples dynamics in fish populations and habitat suitability to predict fish assemblage composition, based on readily available biotic information (preferences for habitat, temperature, and food, and characteristics of spawning) and day-to-day variability in stream conditions. 3. We illustrate the model using Piedmont headwater streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed of the USA, projecting ten scenarios: Baseline (low urbanization; no on-going construction; and present-day climate); one Urbanization scenario (higher impervious surface, lower forest cover, significant construction activity); four future climate change scenarios [Hadley CM3 and Parallel Climate Models under medium-high (A2) and medium-low (B2) emissions scenarios]; and the same four climate change scenarios plus Urbanization. 4. Urbanization alone depressed growth or reproduction of 8 of 39 species, while climate change alone depressed 22 to 29 species. Almost every recreationally important species (i.e. trouts, basses, sunfishes) and six of the ten currently most common species were predicted to be significantly stressed. The combined effect of climate change and urbanization on adult growth was sometimes large compared to the effect of either stressor alone. Thus, the model predicts considerable change in fish assemblage composition, including loss of diversity. 5. Synthesis and applications. The interaction of climate change and urban growth may entail significant reconfiguring of headwater streams, including a loss of ecosystem structure and services, which will be more costly than climate change alone. On local scales, stakeholders cannot control climate drivers but they can mitigate stream impacts via careful land use. Therefore, to conserve stream ecosystems, we recommend that proactive measures be taken to insure against species loss or severe population declines. Delays will inevitably exacerbate the impacts of both climate change and urbanization on headwater systems. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

The sensitivity of marine species to climate change is increasingly being described with forecasted species distributions, yet these rarely account for population level processes such as genomic variation and local adaptation. This study compares inter- and intraspecific patterns of biological composition to determine how vulnerability to climate change, and its environmental drivers, vary across species and populations. We compare species trajectories for three ecologically important southern African marine invertebrates at two time points in the future, both at the species level, with correlative species distribution models, and at the population level, with gradient forest models. Reported range shifts are species-specific and include both predicted range gains and losses. Forecasted species responses to climate change are strongly influenced by changes in a suite of environmental variables, from sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, to minimum air temperature. Our results further suggest a mismatch between future habitat suitability (where species can remain in their ecological niche) and genomic vulnerability (where populations retain their genomic composition), highlighting the inter- and intraspecific variability in species' sensitivity to global change. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of considering species and population level climatic vulnerability when proactively managing coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene.},

Furthermore, new environmental conditions may favour naturally generated hybrids between native and introduced tree species over native species. Methods:A greenhouse experiment with freezing tests was carried out to study how water (low, medium, high) and N (low, high) supply influence the growth, bud phenology and frost hardening of seven young European aspen (Populus tremula) and backcross hybrid aspen ([P. tremula \texttimes{} Populus tremuloides] \texttimes{} P. tremula) families. Results:The native European aspen grew faster, whereas hybrid aspen \texttimes{} aspen frost hardened faster and exhibited better overall frost hardiness and earlier budburst. Hybrid aspen \texttimes{} aspen also showed intraspecific variation in frost hardiness. The two species showed similar responses to different water and N supplies, and both species were more affected by changes in N supply than in water supply. Higher N supply-especially when combined with drought-delayed frost hardening, an effect that was more pronounced in European aspen. Conclusions: The results suggest that backcross hybrid aspen may in some respects be better adapted to a range of environmental conditions than the native species. \textcopyright{} INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

  abstract = {Human activities impact marine ecosystems at a global scale and all levels of complexity of life. Despite their importance as key players in ecosystem processes, the stress caused to microorganisms has been greatly neglected. This fact is aggravated by difficulties in the analysis of microbial communities and their high diversity, making the definition of patterns difficult. In this review, we discuss the effects of nutrient increase, pollution by organic chemicals and heavy metals and the introduction of antibiotics and pathogens into the environment. Microbial communities respond positively to nutrients and chemical pollution by increasing cell numbers. There are also significant changes in community composition, increases in diversity and high temporal variability. These changes, which evidence the modification of the environmental conditions due to anthropogenic stress, usually alter community functionality, although this aspect has not been explored in depth. Altered microbial communities in human-impacted marine environments can in turn have detrimental effects on human health (i.e. spread of pathogens and antibiotic resistance). New threats to marine ecosystems, i.e. related to climate change, could also have an impact on microbial communities. Therefore, an effort dedicated to analyse the microbial compartment in detail should be made when studying the impact of anthropogenic activities on marine ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

  abstract = {Individual differences in metabolic rate have been linked with variations in behaviour and key life-history traits and can affect ecological patterns within animal populations. Yet, almost nothing is known of the plasticity of the metabolic response under dynamically changing conditions that are representative of the natural environment. This is surprising since the capacity for animals to cope with rapidly changing environments depends on phenotypic variation and plasticity among members of the population. We measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) of 60 juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) under acclimation conditions (35 ppt salinity, 29 \textdegree C, normoxia) and when the fish were sequentially faced with low salinity (10 ppt), high temperature (35 \textdegree C) and hypoxia (45\% air saturation) with each treatment separated by {$\sim$}12 days. The overall degree of interindividual variation in body-mass-standardised SMR, MMR and AS changed with environmental conditions, and a metabolic coupling was revealed between SMR and MMR when the fish were faced with the environmental changes. The metabolic response to environmental change differed widely and predictably at an individual level. Individuals that had elevated metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions showed little change in SMR, MMR or AS in response to low salinity and high temperature, but MMR and AS were greatly depressed by hypoxia. In contrast, individuals with low-metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions displayed a substantial increase in SMR, MMR and AS in response to high temperature and (to a lesser extent) low salinity, but hypoxia had very little effect. These findings reveal how phenotypic diversity in key physiological traits can create differential plasticity towards environmental change within a population by showing how individual fish can remain metabolically insensitive to one environmental stressor at the cost of being highly sensitive to another.},

Here we explore the causes of intraspecific and phenotypic variation at the organ, tissue and mitochondrial levels. We highlight the growing evidence that individuals differ predictably in the flexibility of their metabolic rates and in the extent to which they can suppress minimal metabolism when food is limiting but increase the capacity for aerobic metabolism when a high work rate is beneficial. It is unclear why this intraspecific variation in metabolic flexibility persists\textemdash possibly because of trade-offs with the flexibility of other traits\textemdash but it has consequences for the ability of populations to respond to a changing world. It is clear that metabolic rates are targets of selection, but more research is needed on the fitness consequences of rates of metabolism and their plasticity at different life stages, especially in natural conditions.},

This has hindered the application of theory for understanding community structure and perturbation responses. Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term "community matrix." We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed.

The chemical profiles of seven populations spreading over 1200 km in the Western Mediterranean were obtained by a straightforward SPE-HPLC-DAD-ELSD process whereas the identity of compounds was assessed by comparison between HPLC-MS spectra and literature data. Chemical diversity calculated by richness and Shannon indexes differed significantly between sponge populations but not at a larger regional scale. We used factor analysis, analysis of variance, and regression analysis to examine the chemical variability of this sponge at local and regional scales, to establish general patterns of variation in chemical diversity. The abundance of some metabolites varied significantly between sponge populations. Despite these significant differences between populations, we found a clear pattern of increasing chemical dissimilarity with increasing geographic distance. Additional large spatial scale studies on the chemical diversity of marine organisms will validate the universality or exclusivity of this pattern.},

In this study we focused on urban stressors that are ubiquitous to urban estuarine systems worldwide: elevated nutrients, toxic chemical contaminants, built infrastructure and non-indigenous species (NIS). We investigated structural (abundance, diversity and species richness) and functional endpoints (productivity, primary production (chlorophyll-a) and metabolism) commonly used to determine responses to these selected stressors. Through a systematic review of global literature, we found 579 studies of our selected stressors; 93\% measured responses to a single stressor, with few assessing the effects of multiple stressors (7\%). Structural endpoints were commonly used to measure the effects of stressors (49\% of the total 579 studies). Whereas, functional endpoints were rarely assessed alone (10\%) but rather in combination with structural endpoints (41\%). Elevated nutrients followed by NIS were the most studied single stressors (43\% and 16\% of the 541 single stressor studies), while elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants were overwhelmingly the most common stressor combination (79\% of the 38 multiple stressor studies); with NIS and built infrastructure representing major gaps in multi-stressor research. In the meta-analysis, structural endpoints tended to decrease, while functional endpoints increased and/or decreased in response to different types of organisms or groups. We predicted an antagonistic effect of elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants based on the opposing enriching versus toxic effects of this stressor combination. Of note, biodiversity was the only endpoint that revealed such an antagonistic response. Our results highlight the continuing paucity of multiple stressor studies and provide evidence for opposing patterns in the responses to single and interacting stressors depending on the measured endpoint. The latter is of significant consequence to understanding relevant impacts of stressors in coastal monitoring and management.},

Climatic change and the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are ranking high in scientific and public agendas, and other components of global change are also frequently addressed, among which are the introductions of non indigenous species (NIS) in biogeographic regions well separated from the donor region, often followed by spectacular invasions. In the marine environment, both climatic change and spread of alien species have been studied extensively; this review is aimed at examining the main responses of ecosystems to climatic change, taking into account the increasing importance of biological invasions. Some general principles on NIS introductions in the marine environment are recalled, such as the importance of propagule pressure and of development stages during the time course of an invasion. Climatic change is known to affect many ecological properties; it interacts also with NIS in many possible ways. Direct (proximate) effects on individuals and populations of altered physical-chemical conditions are distinguished from indirect effects on emergent properties (species distribution, diversity, and production). Climatically driven changes may affect both local dispersal mechanisms, due to the alteration of current patterns, and competitive interactions between NIS and native species, due to the onset of new thermal optima and/or different carbonate chemistry. As well as latitudinal range expansions of species correlated with changing temperature conditions, and effects on species richness and the correlated extinction of native species, some invasions may provoke multiple effects which involve overall ecosystem functioning (material flow between trophic groups, primary production, relative extent of organic material decomposition, extent of benthic-pelagic coupling). Some examples are given, including a special mention of the situation of the Mediterranean Sea, where so many species have been introduced recently, and where some have spread in very large quantities. An increasing effort by marine scientists is required, not only to monitor the state of the environment, but also to help predicting future changes and finding ways to mitigate or manage them. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In the marine sciences an increasing number of studies on environmental changes, their causes, and environmental assessments emerged in recent years. Often authors use non-uniform and inconsistent definitions of key terms like driver, threats, pressures etc. Although all of these studies clearly define causal dependencies between the interacting socio-economic and environmental systems in an understandable way, still an overall imprecise wording could induce misunderstanding at higher policy levels when it comes to integrated ecosystems assessments. Therefore we recommend using unified definitions for a better communication between science and management within national, regional and international environmental policies, for example the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). With this article we provide definitions compatible with the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) approach. Although most examples are MSFD related and thus have a marine focus the definitions are intended to be equally applicable for other systems and are usable world-wide. We suggest sticking to these definitions for an easy and simplified knowledge transfer from science to management, since DPSIR model is already accepted as a helpful tool for structuring and communicating ecosystem analyses.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific variation in body size is common in animals and plants. Body size affects trophic interactions like foraging ability and vulnerability to predation, which in turn affect individual fitness as well as population stability and extinction risk. Experimental and theoretical work has shown that the size distribution of individuals within cohorts is strongly influenced by intraspecific competition for resources, often leading to skewed frequency distributions. However, little is known about the effects of environmental factors such as climate and eutrophication on the cohort size-structure of natural populations. We use a long-term time series of scientific monitoring of a freshwater fish (European perch Perca fluviatilis) to investigate the effects of density dependence, predation, nutrient availability, climate and the timing of spawning on the cohort size distributions. We find that the mean length of the fish is best predicted by the extrinsic factors phosphorus concentration and summer temperature, and the densities of the different age-classes, whereas the skewness of the length distribution is best predicted by phosphorus concentration, summer temperature, abundance of small fish, and the timing of spawning. Higher nutrient levels, temperatures and densities of small fish increase food availability and thus reduce competition, which is reflected in increased mean length and decreased skewness. The timing of spawning affects skewness presumably through changes in the initial size variation of the cohort and the length of the first growth season. Our results indicate that higher temperatures increase the mean length and decrease skewness due to the concurrent eutrophication of the lake. The study thereby highlights the potential impact of human-induced environmental change on the size structure of fish populations. More studies are needed to understand better the complex mechanisms through which these factors alter the intensity of intraspecific competition in fish communities. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors.

Understanding how such trait variation affects population and ecosystem dynamics is critically important, because future environmental change and human impacts are expected to alter phenotypic trait distributions. In species with seasonal reproduction, offspring size variation within cohorts is ubiquitous, yet we know little about its implications for population stability. In addition, long-term monitoring data indicate that changes in offspring size variation occur at ecologically relevant time scales. Here, we study the consequences of changing offspring size variation by developing and analysing an integral projection model (IPM). Our model accounts for size-dependent cannibalism as well as additional density regulation occurring during the first year. The model is parameterized using literature values and long-term monitoring data for pike Esox lucius, a common fish predator in temperate freshwater ecosystems, but the general model structure applies to a wide range of size-structured organisms. Our analyses demonstrate that a wide size distribution of offspring promotes stable dynamics, whereas narrow distributions can be destabilizing because cannibalism increases the annual variation in mean offspring mortality. Our results indicate that the stabilizing effect of offspring size variation is likely an important property of size-structured organisms with seasonal reproduction and cannibalistic behaviour. This work highlights the importance of intracohort trait variation and describes how variation in body size can shape the dynamics of animal populations.},

Each of these regions has been invaded multiple times in recent decades by Ponto-Caspian invertebrates and fishes. In attempt to identify predictable patterns, we compared the magnitude and direction of the impacts of these invaders on ecosystem components (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fish) and processes within each region. Most introductions appear to have increased local species richness rather than replace native species. Their impact on functional (rather than taxonomic) diversity, however, is of ecological importance. Ponto-Caspian organisms have become dominant members of various trophic levels (herbivores, detritivores and consumers) in benthic and pelagic food webs. They have apparently caused large-scale ecosystem impacts in the Great Lakes, whereas their role in Baltic Sea ecosystem is less pronounced, more spatially limited and, in part, camouflaged by other long-term ecological changes such as eutrophication. In all three regions, Ponto-Caspian invaders have altered multiple abio tic and biotic components and energy flow of ecosystems. Owing to the paucity of studies using pre - and post-invasion datasets, we cannot yet produce robust predictions for most of these invaders.

These immigrated to the sea 10,000 to 15,000 years ago or have been introduced to the area over the relatively recent history of the system. The Baltic Sea has only one known endemic species. While information on some abiotic parameters extends back as long as five centuries and first quantitative snapshot data on biota (on exploited fish populations) originate generally from the same time, international coordination of research began in the early twentieth century. Continuous, annual Baltic Sea-wide long-term datasets on several organism groups (plankton, benthos, fish) are generally available since the mid-1950s. Based on a variety of available data sources (published papers, reports, grey literature, unpublished data), the Baltic Sea, incl. Kattegat, hosts altogether at least 6,065 species, including at least 1,700 phytoplankton, 442 phytobenthos, at least 1,199 zooplankton, at least 569 meiozoobenthos, 1,476 macrozoobenthos, at least 380 vertebrate parasites, about 200 fish, 3 seal, and 83 bird species. In general, but not in all organism groups, high sub-regional total species richness is associated with elevated salinity. Although in comparison with fully marine areas the Baltic Sea supports fewer species, several facets of the system's diversity remain underexplored to this day, such as micro-organisms, foraminiferans, meiobenthos and parasites. In the future, climate change and its interactions with multiple anthropogenic forcings are likely to have major impacts on the Baltic biodiversity.},

This paper offers literature-based analysis on the effects of the widespread (occurring in at least 50\% of countries) and currently established NIS on ecosystem features in the Baltic Sea. It appears that out of the 18 NIS taxa studied, there are no published records on 28\% of NIS for any of the seven impact categories investigated. When ecological impacts are known, laboratory experimental evidence dominates over field studies. Combined observations on impact strength, information type and confidence level suggest that the two benthic invertebrates, the polychaete Marenzelleria spp. and the zebra mussel Dreissenapolymorpha (Pallas 1771) exert the highest ecosystem impact. Despite continuously accumulating information on the NIS effects, however, the confidence of findings is still low. Thus, we still understand very little on both the direction and magnitude of the effects of even the most widespread NIS on the structure and dynamics of the Baltic Sea ecosystems. In order to increase reliability of such assessments, future research should be targeted towards spatially-explicit field surveys and experimenting of multitrophic systems, together with modelling of ecosystem impact.},

The report on biovolumes and size-classes of phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea has been produced by the HELCOM Phytoplankton Expert Group (PEG). Most laboratories involved in the HELCOM Baltic Monitoring Programme (COMBINE) have contributed to the work, us ing regional phytoplankton data. Distinct size-classes and biovolumes were agreed upon and established for most Baltic species which are possible to identify using a light microscope and the Uterm\"ohl counting technique. The need for a comprehensive compilation was recognised already at the beginning of the phytoplankton studies in the framework of the Baltic Monitoring Programme. Since quality assurance of data is an important component of the HELCOM monitoring programm e, measures were taken to evaluate and improve the recommended methods through intercalibrations between the different partners. In 1991 HELCOM PEG was established, with the main aim to unify methods of collection, counting and identification of phytopla nkton species. Since accurate biomass estimates are important in phytoplankton monitoring, PEG also made considerable efforts to standardise size-classes and biovolumes of phytoplankton species found in the Baltic Sea. It is recommended that the present list with biovolumes and fixed size-classes be used for the calculation of phytoplankton biomass in routine monitoring of Baltic Sea phytoplankton and the aim is for it to become an integral component of HELCOMs phytopl ankton counting programme, PhytoWin. The list will be updated as new information is obtained. The use of a standardised species list with fixed size-classes and biovolumes will be a decisive measure for improving the quality of the phytoplankton counting method and the comparability of results.

A large dynamic range is particularly prevalent when the populations are highly abundant, change considerably over time, and exhibit a large signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast, MAR models are better suited for analyses of populations with low abundances and for investigations where the quantification of noise is important.We conclude that the choice of either one or the other modeling framework should be guided by the specific goals of the analysis and the dynamic features of the data.

So far, three main bet-hedging strategies have been described: conservative bet-hedging (play it safe), diversified bet-hedging (don't put all eggs in one basket) and adaptive coin flipping (choose a strategy at random from a fixed distribution). Within this context, we analyse the trade-off between many small eggs (or seeds) and few large, given an unpredictable environment. Our model is an extension of previous models and allows for any combination of the bet-hedging strategies mentioned above. In our individual-based model (accounting for both ecological and evolutionary forces), the optimal bet-hedging strategy is a combination of conservative and diversified bet-hedging and adaptive coin flipping, which means a variation in egg size both within clutches and between years. Hence, we show how phenotypic variation within a population, often assumed to be due to non-adaptive variation, instead can be the result of females having this mixed strategy. Our results provide a new perspective on bet-hedging and stress the importance of extreme events in life history evolution.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presence-absence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC - species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias - species model: 1.31 and -0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and -0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26\% habitat loss or UTF: 24\% habitat loss vs. species model: 60\% habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8\% habitat gain or UTF: 12\% habitat gain vs. species model: 51\% habitat loss) in the climatic period 2070-2100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

  abstract = {The level of phenotypic plasticity displayed within a population (i.e. the slope of the reaction norm) reflects the short-term response of a population to environmental change, while variation in reaction norm slopes among populations reflects spatial variation in these responses. Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow ({$\sim$}200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations. \textcopyright{} The Author 2015.},

Here, we investigate seasonal plasticity and adaptive potential in an Afrotropical butterfly expressing distinct phenotypes in dry and wet seasons. We assess the transcriptional architecture of plasticity in a full-factorial analysis of heritable and environmental effects across 72 individuals, and reveal pervasive gene expression differences between the seasonal phenotypes. Strikingly, intra-population genetic variation for plasticity is largely absent, consistent with specialisation to a particular environmental cue reliably predicting seasonal transitions. Under climate change, deteriorating accuracy of predictive cues will likely aggravate maladaptive phenotype-environment mismatches and increase selective pressures on reaction norms. However, the observed paucity of genetic variation for plasticity limits evolutionary responses, potentially weakening prospects for population persistence. Thus, seasonally plastic species may be especially vulnerable to climate change.},

However, models forecasting the impact of climate change on natural environments do not often consider the geographic variation of an organism's life history. We examined variation in developmental plasticity to changing temperature in the pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae) across its distribution by studying populations from central areas (Poland), edge populations (Latvia) and northern marginal populations (Sweden). Relative to central and edge populations, northern populations experience lower and less variable temperature and fewer episodes of warm weather during larval development. Plasticity in larval life-history traits was highest at the northern range margin: larvae from marginal populations shortened larval period and increased growth rate more than larvae from central and edge populations when reared at high temperature. Maintaining high growth and development under the scarce spells of warm weather is likely adaptive for high-latitude populations. The detection of high levels of developmental plasticity in isolated, marginal populations suggests that they may be better able to respond to the temperature regimes expected under climate change than often predicted, reflecting the need to incorporate geographic variation in life-history traits into models forecasting responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

They belong to different clades in Dreissena phylogenetics: D. rostriformis bugensis genetically is coupled with the brackish water, lacustrine D. r. distincta and the two are believed to represent a single species. As such, the guaqqa mussel has environmental requirements that differ from the congeneric D. polymorpha. D. rostriformis bugensis invasions were confined to reservoirs of the Dnieper, Don and Dniester Rivers of the Black Sea basin. We recorded D. r. bugensis outside the Black Sea basin for the first time between 1992 and 2001, along the Volga River reservoir cascade including the Northern Caspian Sea shallows. This represents a 40-year invasion time lag since an invasion corridor through the Volgo-Don Waterway was established in 1952 (a corridor used extensively by many invertebrate species from the Black Sea region). We attribute the postponed invasion of Europe by D. r. bugensis, including peculiarities in establishment and its absence in fossil records, to its phylogenetically close relationship with D. r. distincta and its recent evolutionary origin. The relatively rapid range expansion of D. r. bugensis in eastern Europe during the past several decades was facilitated by human-mediated ecosystem transformation, notably impoundment of large eastern European rivers, that have allowed this species to utilize newly transformed ecosystems.},

Multiple-stressor research is a rapidly expanding field of science that seeks to understand and ultimately predict the interactions between stressors. Reviews and meta-analyses of the primary scientific literature have largely been specific to either freshwater, marine or terrestrial ecology, or ecotoxicology. In this cross-disciplinary study, we review the state of knowledge within and among these disciplines to highlight commonality and division in multiple-stressor research. Our review goes beyond a description of previous research by using quantitative bibliometric analysis to identify the division between disciplines and link previously disconnected research communities. Towards a unified research framework, we discuss the shared goal of increased realism through both ecological and temporal complexity, with the overarching aim of improving predictive power. In a rapidly changing world, advancing our understanding of the cumulative ecological impacts of multiple stressors is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Identifying and overcoming the barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange is necessary in rising to this challenge. Division between ecosystem types and disciplines is largely a human creation. Species and stressors cross these borders and so should the scientists who study them.},

  abstract = {Global change encompasses many co-occurring anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the interactions between these multiple stressors, whether they be additive, antagonistic or synergistic, is critical for ecosystem managers when prioritizing which stressors to mitigate in the face of global change. While such interactions between stressors appear prevalent, it remains unclear if and how these interactions change over time, as the majority of multiple-stressor studies rarely span multiple generations of study organisms. Although meta-analyses have reported some intriguing temporal trends in stressor interactions, for example that synergism may take time to emerge, the mechanistic basis for such observations is unknown. In this study, by analysing data from an evolution experiment with the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus ( 35 generations and 31,320 observations), we show that adaptation to multiple stressors shifts stressor interactions towards synergism. We show that trade-offs, where populations cannot optimally perform multiple tasks (i.e. adapting to multiple stressors), generate this bias towards synergism. We also show that removal of stressors from evolved populations does not necessarily increase fitness and that there is variation in the evolutionary trajectories of populations that experienced the same stressor regimes. Our results highlight outstanding questions at the interface between evolution and global change biology, and illustrate the importance of considering rapid adaptation when managing or restoring ecosystems subjected to multiple stressors under global change.},

  abstract = {Human influences have created a world where all ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors with diverse characteristics and impacts. Organizing this ever-expanding list of stressors presents the opportunity to derive general rules, to understand effects and to improve predictions. Assessing the similarity of anthropogenic stressors can be approached from different perspectives, which we synthesize here. Stressors can be compared by asking what they are (traits), why they are present (sources), where they occur (spatial overlap), when they occur (temporal overlap), how they affect organisms (mode of action) and who they affect (co-tolerance). Some concepts of stressor similarity are thus related to intrinsic features of the stressors themselves (e.g. sources and traits), while other concepts pertain to the similarity of the effects of stressors and are therefore dependent on the ecological scale at which the effects of stressors are measured (e.g. mode of action and co-tolerance). Viewing stressor similarity as a multi-faceted and scale-dependent concept will open new avenues for stressor classification, will enhance predictions of the combined effects of stressors and may even inform the management of novel or emerging stressors. Keypoints The anthropogenic stressors that are impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide can be physical (e.g. warming), chemical (e.g. pesticides) or biological (e.g. disease) in nature. We show that stressors can be compared by asking what they are, why they are present, where they occur, when they occur, how they affect organisms and who, or which organisms, they affect. Understanding the similarity of stressors requires interdisciplinary collaboration and will help us to manage species and habitats threatend by a growing number of stressors.},

To characterize the patterns of growth and removal rates of this fraction of organisms in Mobile Bay, we carried out modified dilution experiments in summer and winter at 3 stations along a salinity and nutrient gradient. Rates of growth, grazing and viral lysis for prokaryotes and domi- nant phytoplankton (cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates) were determined for each exper- iment. Grazing and viral lysis of prokaryotes did not appear to be related to season or location, and both processes were detected within the bay as well as on the shelf. For phytoplankton, grazing was the dominant removal process inshore in the summer, while viral lysis of phytoplankton was detected in the fall and in winter. In winter, an apparent increase in dinoflagellates, and in the overall biomass of phytoplankton, was concurrent with increased viral lysis, suggesting that recy- cling by viruses may be an important source of nutrients in coastal waters.},

Here, we provide a comparison between resource-rich (putative microrefugia for species preferring mesic habitats under increasing aridity) and resource-impoverished woodlands (non-refugia) around two granite outcrops in south-western Australia. We measured and compared six functional traits (bark thickness, foliar {$\delta$}13C, foliar C:N, leaf dry matter content, plant height, specific leaf area) in four woody species. We performed multiple-trait, multiple-species and single-trait, within-species analyses to test whether plants in resource-rich habitats were functionally distinct and more diverse than those in the surrounding resource-impoverished woodlands. We found that species in resource-rich woodlands occupied larger and distinct multiple-trait functional spaces and showed distinct single-trait values (for specific leaf area and bark thickness). This suggests that plants in resource-rich woodlands can deploy unique and more diverse ecological strategies, potentially making these putative microrefugia more resilient to environmental changes. These findings suggest that species in microrefugia may be characterised by unique functional signatures, illustrating the utility of comparative trait-based approaches to improve understanding of the functioning of refugia.},

Several long-term studies have reported changes in trait distributions along with demographic response to environmental change. Here we conducted an experimental study on soil mites and investigated the interaction between demography and an individual trait over a period of nonstationary dynamics. By following individual fates and body sizes at each life-history stage, we investigated how body size and population density influenced demographic rates. By comparing the ability of two alternative approaches, a matrix projection model and an integral projection model, we investigated whether consideration of trait-based demography enhances our ability to predict transient dynamics. By utilizing a prospective perturbation analysis, we addressed which stage-specific demographic or trait-transition rate had the greatest influence on population dynamics. Both body size and population density had important effects on most rates; however, these effects differed substantially among life-history stages. Considering the observed trait-demography relationships resulted in better predictions of a population's response to perturbations, which highlights the role of phenotypic plasticity in transient dynamics. Although the perturbation analyses provided comparable predictions of stage-specific elasticities between the matrix and integral projection models, the order of importance of the life-history stages differed between the two analyses. In conclusion, we demonstrate how a trait-based demographic approach provides further insight into transient population dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2012 by The University of Chicago.},

This trend, revealed by Remane in 1934 and later on confirmed by many other scientists, was compared to the salinity range of already established NIS in the European brackish water seas. It turned out that most NIS are well adapted to the salinities holding lowest native species richness, already in their native area, and that NIS richness maximum in brackish water seas occurs in the salinity intervals of native species richness minimum. A predictable pattern in the salinity range of NIS can be used as a tool in initial risk assessment of future invasions in brackish water seas, especially when mapping highly potential donor and recipient areas. A product of empty niches, suitable environmental conditions, and availability of proper vectors might be the most effective predictor for the invasibility of brackish water areas. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background. At the end of 1980s, ecological regime shifts occurred in the Baltic. Since, the Baltic fish assemblage has been dominated by sprats, whereas before cod was the dominant fish species. The majority of previous food studies refer to the period before the shift. This raises the question, how changes in the Baltic ecosystem have affected the diet of cod. The aim of the presently reported study was to identify the differences in the food composition of cod depending on the area, depth, season, and the cod size and compare it with the findings from the 1970s and 1980s. Materials and methods. Food composition and selection of prey size for Baltic cod was evaluated by examining the stomach contents of 556 adult cod, collected in 2006 and 2007. Fish stomachs were sampled from research catches within the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Results. The main component of the cod diet were the clupeids, constituting more than 67\% of the total weight of the food recovered from the specimens studied. Other fishes in the diet represented Gobiidae, Ammodytidae, as well as young cod. The dominant invertebrate in the diet was the isopod Saduria entomon which accounted for 13\% of the diet by weight. The weight proportion of larger fish, such as herring, Clupea harengus (L.), and cod, increased with the cod size, while the proportion of small and medium-sized fish (sprats, gobies) decreased. The food composition of cod varied seasonally. The weight proportion of European sprat, Sprattus sprattus (L.), was much higher in winter (55\%) than in fall (27\%), while the proportion of cod in the diet was higher in the fall (10\%) than in winter (4\%). The proportion of sprat in the diet increased with depth, while that of Ammodytidae and Gobiidae showed a decreasing trend. At depths greater than 40 m, the proportion of invertebrates in cod stomachs decreased. This study demonstrated a significant area effect for sprat; year effect for sprat and Saduria entomon; a seasonal effect for young cod and S. entomon; and a depth effect for sprat, young cod, and S. entomon. The occurrences of herring and small cod increased in the stomach as the predator increased, while no significant relation was found for sprat and S. entomon. The data collected do not indicate that cod select a specific size of sprat or herring, though cod were found to use size selection for S. entomon and juvenile cod. Conclusion. The food composition of cod has undergone certain changes compared to results of Za\l achowski (1977, 1985), which covered the 1970s and 1980s. Currently, the proportion of clupeids in the food is approximately 67\% (in weight), while during the 1977-1982 it was in the range of 25\%-50\% depending on cod length. In 2006 and 2007 sprat was the main cod diet component rather than herring.},

  abstract = {Bushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit.) is one among the world's most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we quantify the evolution of elevated thermal tolerance in the phytoplankton, Chlorella vulgaris. Initially, population growth was limited at higher temperatures because respiration was more sensitive to temperature than photosynthesis meaning less carbon was available for growth. Tolerance to high temperature evolved after {$\approx$} 100 generations via greater down-regulation of respiration relative to photosynthesis. By down-regulating respiration, phytoplankton overcame the metabolic constraint imposed by the greater temperature sensitivity of respiration and more efficiently allocated fixed carbon to growth. Rapid evolution of carbon-use efficiency provides a potentially general mechanism for thermal adaptation in phytoplankton and implies that evolutionary responses in phytoplankton will modify biogeochemical cycles and hence food web structure and function under warming. Models of climate futures that ignore adaptation would usefully be revisited. Copyright},

  abstract = {Suspended algae, or phytoplankton, are the prime source of organic matter supporting food webs in freshwater ecosystems. Phytoplankton productivity is reliant on adequate nutrient supplies; however, increasing rates of nutrient supply, much of it manmade, fuels accelerating primary production or eutrophication. An obvious and problematic symptom of eutrophication is rapid growth and accumulations of phytoplankton, leading to discoloration of affected waters. These events are termed blooms. Blooms are a prime agent of water quality deterioration, including foul odors and tastes, deoxygenation of bottom waters (hypoxia and anoxia), toxicity, fish kills, and food web alterations. Toxins produced by blooms can adversely affect animal (including human) health in waters used for recreational and drinking purposes. Numerous freshwater genera within the diverse phyla comprising the phytoplankton are capable of forming blooms; however, the blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) are the most notorious bloom formers. This is especially true for harmful toxic, surface-dwelling, scum-forming genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Nodularia, Microcystis) and some subsurface bloom-formers (Cylindrospermopsis, Oscillatoria) that are adept at exploiting nutrient-enriched conditions. They thrive in highly productive waters by being able to rapidly migrate between radiance-rich surface waters and nutrient-rich bottom waters. Furthermore, many harmful species are tolerant of extreme environmental conditions, including very high light levels, high temperatures, various degrees of desiccation, and periodic nutrient deprivation. Some of the most noxious cyanobacterial bloom genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Nodularia) are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N2), enabling them to periodically dominate under nitrogen-limited conditions. Cyanobacteria produce a range of organic compounds, including those that are toxic to higher-ranked consumers, from zooplankton to further up the food chain. Both N2- and non-N2-fixing genera participate in mutualistic and symbiotic associations with microorganisms, higher plants, and animals. These associations appear to be of great benefit to their survival and periodic dominance. In this review, we address the ecological impacts and environmental controls of harmful blooms, with an emphasis on the ecology, physiology, and management of cyanobacterial bloom taxa. Combinations of physical, chemical, and biotic features of natural waters function in a synergistic fashion to determine the sensitivity of water bodies. In waters susceptible to blooms, human activities in water- and airsheds have been linked to the extent and magnitudes of blooms. Control and management of cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton blooms invariably includes nutrient input constraints, most often focused on nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P). The types and amount of nutrient input constraints depend on hydrologic, climatic, geographic, and geologic factors, which interact with anthropogenic and natural nutrient input regimes. While single nutrient input constraints may be effective in some water bodies, dual N and P input reductions are usually required for effective long-term control and management of harmful blooms. In some systems where hydrologic manipulations (i.e., plentiful water supplies) are possible, reducing the water residence time by enhanced flushing and artificial mixing (in conjunction with nutrient input constraints) can be particularly effective alternatives. Implications of various management strategies, based on combined ecophysiological and environmental considerations, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history ({$\sim$}3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.},

Despite these differences, cyanobacteria from the genus Synechococcus are important primary producers in both types of ecosystems. We have found that the genome of a coastal cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. strain CC9311, has significant differences from an open ocean strain, Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102, and these are consistent with the differences between their respective environments. CC9311 has a greater capacity to sense and respond to changes in its (coastal) environment. It has a much larger capacity to transport, store, use, or export metals, especially iron and copper. In contrast, phosphate acquisition seems less important, consistent with the higher concentration of phosphate in coastal environments. CC9311 is predicted to have differences in its outer membrane lipopolysaccharide, and this may be characteristic of the speciation of some cyanobacterial groups. In addition, the types of potentially horizontally transferred genes are markedly different between the coastal and open ocean genomes and suggest a more prominent role for phages in horizontal gene transfer in oligotrophic environments.},

  abstract = {The effects of ocean acidification and increased temperature on physiology of six strains of the polar diatom \emph{Fragilariopsis cylindrus} from Greenland were investigated. Experiments were performed under manipulated pH levels (8.0, 7.7, 7.4, and 7.1) and different temperatures (1, 5 and 8 \textdegree C) to simulate changes from present to plausible future levels. Each of the 12 scenarios was run for 7 days, and a significant interaction between temperature and pH on growth was detected. By combining increased temperature and acidification, the two factors counterbalanced each other, and therefore no effect on the growth rates was found. However, the growth rates increased with elevated temperatures by \&sim;20\textendash 50\% depending on the strain. In addition, a general negative effect of increasing acidification on growth was observed. At pH 7.7 and 7.4, the growth response varied considerably among strains. However, a more uniform response was detected at pH 7.1 with most of the strains exhibiting reduced growth rates by 20\textendash 37\% compared to pH 8.0. It should be emphasized that a significant interaction between temperature and pH was found, meaning that the combination of the two parameters affected growth differently than when considering one at a time. Based on these results, we anticipate that the polar diatom \emph{F. cylindrus} will be unaffected by changes in temperature and pH within the range expected by the end of the century. In each simulated scenario, the variation in growth rates among the strains was larger than the variation observed due to the whole range of changes in either pH or temperature. Climate change may therefore not affect the species as such, but may lead to changes in the population structure of the species, with the strains exhibiting high phenotypic plasticity, in terms of temperature and pH tolerance towards future conditions, dominating the population.},

Modern coexistence theory (MCT) and related techniques explore this phenomenon by examining the chance of a species population growing from rarity in the presence of all other species. The mean growth rate when rare, (Formula presented.), is used in MCT as a metric that measures persistence properties (like invasibility or time to extinction) of a population. Here we critique this reliance on (Formula presented.) and show that it fails to capture the effect of temporal random abundance variations on persistence properties. The problem becomes particularly severe when an increase in the amplitude of stochastic temporal environmental variations leads to an increase in (Formula presented.), since at the same time it enhances random abundance fluctuations and the two effects are inherently intertwined. In this case, the chance of invasion and the mean extinction time of a population may even go down as (Formula presented.) increases.},

Hemolymph acid\textendash{} base parameters were monitored over 24 h of exposure to seawater equilibrated with {$\sim$}1\% CO2 (seawater PCO2 {$\sim$}6 torr or 0.8 kPa, pH 7.1), and compared with those of the shallow-living Dungeness crab Cancer magister. Short-term hypercapnia-induced acidosis in the hemolymph of Chionoecetes tanneri was almost uncompensated, with a net 24 h pH reduction of 0.32 units and a net bicarbonate accumulation of only 3 mM. Under simultaneous hypercapnia and hypoxia, short-term extracellular acidosis in Chionoecetes tanneri was completely uncompensated. In contrast, Cancer magister fully recovered its hemolymph pH over 24 h of hypercapnic exposure by net accumulation of 12 mM bicarbonate from the surrounding medium. The data support the hypothesis that deep-sea animals, which are adapted to a stable environment and exhibit reduced metabolic rates, lack the short-term acid\textendash base regulatory capacity to cope with the acute hypercapnic stress that would accompany large-scale CO2 sequestration. Additionally, the data indicate that sequestration in oxygen-poor areas of the ocean would be even more detrimental to deep-sea fauna.},

When diel dynamics were investigated or averages from large-scale environments were used, BS was positively related to bacterial production but no trend was detectable across systems. The across systems' finding that BS was significantly related to the frequency of infected cells (FIC) could be due to co-infection or superinfection.

Natal dispersal distance additionally was affected by social and ecological factors: individuals dispersing in their first year of life moved longer distances than those staying on their natal site as helpers for a prolonged time prior to dispersal, and increasing territory isolation led to longer dispersal distances. Successful dispersers incurred fitness costs, with lifetime fledgling production (in both sexes) and lifetime production of recruits to the breeding population (in females only) decreasing with increasing natal dispersal distance. We conclude that natal dispersal distance has a genetic basis but is modulated by environmental and social factors and that natal dispersal distance in this species is (currently) under selection.},

Using a modification of the seawater dilution approach, we quantified growth and mortality rates for total phytoplankton and picophytoplankton populations (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeu- karyotes) at four contrasting sites in the California Current Ecosystem. Grazing mortality was significant in 10 of 15 cases, while viral effects were significant for 2 cases. Nonetheless, mortality estimates for the entire phytoplankton community based on chlorophyll a were 38+13\% higher when viral effects were included, relative to grazing alone. Mortality estimates for picophytoplankton varied in space and among groups.We also explored a potential methodo- logical constraint of this method and hypothesize that heterotrophic bacteria may be affected by the dilution of their growth-sustaining substrates. For all picophytoplankton, estimates of grazing and viral mortality were inversely related within and across experiments.

  abstract = {Taking a fresh look at Darwin's original theory of the origin of species and following the road paved by Gause, Hutchinson, MacArthur, and Levins a consistent system of fundamental principles is revealed, one that makes the integration of ecology possible. These principles are explained, formalized, and illustrated by mutually compatible mathematical models in this book, demonstrating how this coherent modelling approach helps to explain or predict actual population and community dynamics and patterns on the field or in the lab. At the core of the Darwinian theory of ecology lies a generalized fitness concept applicable to populations of alleles and clones as well as of conspecific individuals. It is the theory of structured populations that provides a universal methodology to calculate the fitness of any reproductive unit in the face of any complexity arising from differences in individual states. The inherent capacity of all living organisms to increase their populations exponentially is necessarily constrained by resource depletion or natural enemies, so that the ultimate growth rate of persistent populations is regulated. Competition between different reproductive units leads either to competitive exclusion or to robust coexistence, depending on how similarly they are regulated. This is shown in general and demonstrated with several types of model. A generalized and formalized niche theory consistent with the principles is explicated, discussed, and illustrated by empirical studies. Studies on global, regional, and local ecological patterns close the book, discussed in the spirit of the process-based approach of Darwinian ecology.},

The subtle changes that temperate phages impart to their hosts in the oceans are far less understood. Occurrences of lysogeny in the oceans correlate well with conditions unfavorable for rapid host growth. In coliphage lambda, phage encoded repressors have been shown to modulate host metabolic gene expression and phenotype, resulting in economizing host energy expenditure. Comparison of lysogenized marine bacteria to the uninfected hosts indicated that prophage acquisition is correlated with host metabolic gene suppression. Screening 113 marine bacterial genomes for prophages yielded 64 prophage-like elements, 21 of which strongly resembled gene transfer agents (GTAs). The remaining 39 putative prophages had a relatively high incidence of transcriptional regulatory and repressor-like proteins (approximately 2/40 kb prophage sequence) compared to lytic marine phages (approximately 0.25/40 kb phage sequence). Here, it has been hypothesized that marine prophages directly contribute to host survival in unfavorable environments by suppression of unneeded metabolic activities. It has been further suggested that such metabolic downshifts are the result of phage-encoded repressors and transcriptional regulators acting directly on host genes. Finally, the widespread occurrence of GTAs may be an efficient mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Aim Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location Madagascar. Methods Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km(2) grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species.},

Alcheringa 39, XXX\textendash XXX. ISSN 0311-5518Evaluation of abundant insect fossils from the Early Pennsylvanian (Namurian) Tupo Formation of northern China (Xiaheyan locality, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) enabled description of a new megasecopteran, i.e., Brodioptera sinensis sp. nov. and emendation of Brodiopteridae. Brodioptera sinensis is defined principally on wing venation characters and darkly pigmented wing apices, but a few have hyaline wing membranes possibly reflecting freshly emerged imagoes or subimagoes without fully developed coloration. The large assemblage of 54 specimens enabled documentation of intra-specific variability in wing venation. In addition, the new species reveals the detailed morphology of the haustellate mouthparts with conspicuous elongated stylets, and external copulatory organs that, previously, were poorly documented or unknown. The male and female external genitalia are similar to members of Protohymenidae (Megasecoptera) and Asthenohymenidae (Diaphanopterodea). Brodioptera sinensis is related to Brodioptera stricklani and Brodioptera cumberlandensis both known from localities in Euramerica suggesting faunal exchange occurred during the Bashkirian. Moreover, based on our analysis of veinal characters and re-examination of the holotype of Sylvohymen pintoi Brauckmann known from Namurian of Hagen-Vorhalle (Germany), we propose transferring this taxon to Brodiopteridae as Brodioptera pintoi comb. nov. Despite the different palaeoclimatic conditions in Euroamerica and Gondwanaland, we assume that Brodiopteridae are closely related to Xenopteridae (type genus: Xenoptera) known solely from South America because these groups have similar venation patterns and were contemporaneous.Martina Pecharov\'a [martina.pecharova@natur.cuni.cz] Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Vini\v{c}n\'a 7, CZ-128 44, Praha 2, Czech Republic; Dong Ren [rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn] Key Lab of Insect Evolution \& Environmental Changes, College of Life Science, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, PR China; Jakub Prokop [jprokop@natur.cuni.cz] Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Vini\v{c}n\'a 7, CZ-128 44, Praha 2, Czech Republic. \textcopyright{} 2015, Association of Australasian Palaeontologists.},

Understanding how genotypes (G), environments (E), and their interaction (genotype and environment; G \texttimes{} E) each affects dispersal propensity is therefore instrumental for predicting the ecological and evolutionary responses of species under global change. Here we used an actively dispersing ciliate to quantify the contributions of G, E, and G \texttimes{} E on dispersal propensity, exposing 44 different genotypes to three different environmental contexts (densities in isogenotype populations). Moreover, we assessed the condition dependence of dispersal, that is, whether dispersal is related to morphological, physiological, or behavioral traits. We found that genotypes showed marked differences in dispersal propensity and that dispersal is plastically adjusted to density, with the overall trend for genotypes to exhibit negative density-dependent dispersal. A small, but significant G \texttimes{} E interaction indicates genetic variability in plasticity and therefore some potential for dispersal plasticity to evolve. We also show evidence consistent with condition-dependent dispersal suggesting that genotypes also vary in how individual condition is linked to dispersal under different environmental contexts thereby generating complex dispersal behavior due to only three variables (genes, environment, and individual condition).},

  abstract = {Dispersal, the movement of individuals among populations, is a life history trait that affects ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species. It has gained much interest in the context of metapopulation dynamics which aim to understand how species cope with habitat loss and fragmentation. In this thesis, I used controlled microcosms of a unicellular organism, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, to experimentally investigate various aspects of dispersal ecology. Firstly, I describe how digital image and video analysis can be used to rapidly and reliably quantify traits and abundances of the model organism. Secondly, I investigated the relative roles of the genotype and the environment on dispersal in a two-patch system by comparing how 44 genetically different lines dispersed in response to conspecific density. We found genetic variation for dispersal plasticity and hence potential for dispersal plasticity to evolve. Thirdly, I report how an individual-based simulation model parameterized with characteristics of video-recorded cell trajectories accounted for 45\% of the variation in dispersal observed among genotypes. Finally, I describe the dispersal syndromes (co-variation of dispersal with other traits) found in this set of genotypes, which bear important information about the costs and evolution of dispersal: (1) negative co-variation of dispersal-related traits with peak cell density and cell survival; (2) the absence of a link between short- and long-distance dispersal. The results in this thesis contribute to our understanding of condition-dependent dispersal, dispersal syndromes, links with the general movement ecology and introduce several methodological advances widely applicable in experimental laboratory systems.},

  abstract = {Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and provide vital services (e.g., photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient recycling). From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.},

Large amounts of data are generated using video-based methods, which can be effectively processed using machine learning (ML) algorithms into meaningful ecological information. ML uses user defined classes (e.g. species), derived from a subset (i.e. training data) of video-observed quantitative features (e.g. phenotypic variation), to infer classes in subsequent observations. However, phenotypic variation often changes due to environmental conditions, which may lead to poor classification, if environmentally induced variation in phenotypes is not accounted for. Here we describe a framework for classifying species under changing environmental conditions based on the random forest classification. A sliding window approach was developed that restricts temporal and environmentally conditions to improve the classification. We tested our approach by applying the classification framework to experimental data. The experiment used a set of six ciliate species to monitor changes in community structure and behavior over hundreds of generations, in dozens of species combinations and across a temperature gradient. Differences in biotic and abiotic conditions caused simplistic classification approaches to be unsuccessful. In contrast, the sliding window approach allowed classification to be highly successful, as phenotypic differences driven by environmental change, could be captured by the classifier. Importantly, classification using the random forest algorithm showed comparable success when validated against traditional, slower, manual identification. Our framework allows for reliable classification in dynamic environments, and may help to improve strategies for long-term monitoring of species in changing environments. Our classification pipeline can be applied in fields assessing species community dynamics, such as eco-toxicology, ecology and evolutionary ecology.},

Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.},

  abstract = {Functional traits are expected to modulate plant competitive dynamics. However, how traits and their plasticity in response to contrasting environments connect with the mechanisms determining species coexistence remains poorly understood. Here, we couple field experiments under two contrasting climatic conditions to a plant population model describing competitive dynamics between 10 annual plant species in order to evaluate how 19 functional traits, covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics, are associated with species' niche and fitness differences. We find a rich diversity of univariate and multidimensional associations, which highlight the primary role of traits related to water- and light-use-efficiency for modulating the determinants of competitive outcomes. Importantly, such traits and their plasticity promote species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species. Our study represents a significant advance showing how leading dimensions of plant function connect to the mechanisms determining the maintenance of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Assessing changes in plant functional traits along gradients is useful for understanding the assembly of communities and their response to global and local environmental drivers. However, these changes may reflect the effects of species composition (i.e. composition turnover), species abundance (i.e. species interaction), and intra-specific trait variability (i.e. species plasticity). In order to determine the relevance of the latter, trait variation can be assessed under minimal effects of composition turnover. Nine sampling sites were established along an altitudinal gradient in a Mediterranean high mountain grassland community with low composition turnover (Madrid, Spain; 1940 m-2419 m). Nine functional traits were also measured for ten individuals of around ten plant species at each site, for a total of eleven species across all sites. The relative importance of different sources of variability (within/ between site and intra-/inter-specific functional diversity) and trait variation at species and community level along the considered gradients were explored. We found a weak individual species response to altitude and other environmental variables although in some cases, individuals were smaller and leaves were thicker at higher elevations. This lack of species response was most likely due to greater within- than between-site species variation. At the community level, inter-specific functional diversity was generally greater than the intraspecific component except for traits linked to leaf element content (leaf carbon content, leaf nitrogen content, {$\delta$} 13 C and {$\delta$} 15 N). Inter-specific functional diversity decreased with lower altitude for four leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, {$\delta$} 13 C and {$\delta$} 15 N), suggesting trait convergence between species at lower elevations, where water shortage may have a stronger environmental filtering effect than colder temperatures at higher altitudes. Our results suggest that, within a vegetation type encompassing various environmental gradients, both, changes in species abundance and intra-specific trait variability adjust for the community functional response to environmental changes. \textcopyright{} 2015 Pescador et al.}

Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature-dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found6,7.

Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

While quagga mussel shell morphology differs between shallow and deep habitats, functional causes and consequences of such difference are unknown. We examined whether quagga mussel shell morphology could be induced by three environmental variables through developmental plasticity. We predicted that shallow-water conditions (high temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype typical of wild quagga mussels from shallow habitats, while deep-water conditions (low temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype present in deep habitats. We tested this prediction by examining shell morphology and growth rate of quagga mussels collected from shallow and deep habitats and reared under common-garden treatments that manipulated the three variables. Shell morphology was quantified using the polar moment of inertia. Of the variables tested, temperature had the greatest effect on shell morphology. Higher temperature (approximately 18-20 degrees C) yielded a morphotype typical of wild shallow mussels regardless of the levels of food quantity or water motion. In contrast, lower temperature (approximately 6-8 degrees C) yielded a morphotype approaching that of wild deep mussels. If shell morphology has functional consequences in particular habitats, a plastic response might confer quagga mussels with a greater ability than zebra mussels to colonize a wider range of habitats within the Great Lakes.},

While interactive effects between both stressors can have more than additive consequences, these remain poorly studied for most taxa. Especially chronic exposure trials with vertebrates are scarce due to the high time- and monetary costs of such studies. We use the recently-established fish model Nothobranchius furzeri to assess the separate and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (at 2 \textmu g/L and 4 \textmu g/L) and a 2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C temperature increase. We performed a full life-cycle assessment to evaluate fitness-related endpoints including survival, total body length, maturation time, fecundity, critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and locomotor activity. Exposure to 4 \textmu g/L chlorpyrifos slowed down male maturation, reduced fecundity and impaired growth of the fish. While the temperature in- crease did not affect any of the measured endpoints on its own, the combination of exposure to 2 \textmu g/L CPF with an increase of 2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C reduced growth and severely reduced fecundity, with almost no offspring production. Together, these findings suggest that climate change may exacerbate the impact of environmental pollution, and that interactive effects of chronic exposure to multiple stressors should be considered to predict how populations will be affected by ongoing global change.}

Nitrogen enrichment typically shifts trait composition by promoting the dominance of acquisitive plants (high specific leaf area [SLA] and low leaf dry matter content [LDMC]), translating into high biomass production. Changes in mean trait values can be due to shifts in species identity, relative abundances and/or intraspecific trait values. However, we do not know the relative importance of these shifts in determining trait responses to environmental changes, or trait effects on ecosystem functioning, such as biomass production. We quantified the relative importance of species composition, abundance and intraspecific shifts in driving variation in SLA and LDMC, and how these shifts affected above- and below-ground biomass. We measured traits in a grassland experiment manipulating nitrogen fertilisation, plant species richness, foliar fungal pathogen removal and sown functional composition (slow vs. fast species). We fitted structural equation models to test the importance of abundance and intraspecific shifts in determining (a) responses of functional composition to treatments and (b) effects on above- and below-ground biomass. We found that species intraspecific shifts were as important as abundance shifts in determining the overall change in functional composition (community weighted mean trait values), and even had large effects compared to substantial initial variation in sown trait composition. Intraspecific trait shifts resulted in convergence towards intermediate SLA in diverse communities; although convergence was reduced by nitrogen addition and enhanced by pathogen removal. In contrast, large intraspecific shifts in LDMC were not influenced by the treatments. However, despite large responses, intraspecific trait shifts had no effect on above- or below-ground biomass. Only interspecific trait variation affected functioning: below-ground biomass was reduced by SLA and increased by LDMC, while above-ground biomass was increased by SLA. Synthesis. Our results add to a growing body of literature showing large intraspecific trait variation and emphasise the importance of using field collected data to determine community functional composition. However, they also show that intraspecific variation does not necessarily affect ecosystem functioning and therefore response\textendash effect trait relationships may differ between versus within species.},

The identification of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed in situations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of "mitigating synergism" is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of the interpretation of synergism and antagonism in situations where individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced.

We consider optimally foraging predators and derive a model for a 1 predator-2 prey interaction with a tilted switching manifold between the two sides of discontinuous vector fields. We show that the 1 predator-2 prey system undergoes a novel adding-sliding-like (center to two-part periodic orbit; "C2PO") bifurcation in which the prey ratio transitions from constant to time-dependent. Farther away from the bifurcation point, the period of the oscillating prey ratio doubles, which suggests a possible cascade to chaos. We compare our model predictions with data on freshwater plankton, and we successfully capture the periodicity in the ratio between the predator's preferred and alternative prey types. Our study suggests that it is useful to investigate prey ratio as a possible indicator of how population dynamics can be influenced by ecosystem diversity.},

Moreover, both warming and hypercapnia increased the heat shock response and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), mainly in post-metamorphic larvae (30 dph). The lack of changes in the activity of CAT and GST of pre-metamorphic larvae (10 dph) seems to indicate that earlier stages lack a fully-developed antioxidant defense system. Nevertheless, the heat shock and antioxidant responses of post-metamorphic larvae were not enough to avoid the peroxidative damage, which was greatly increased under future environmental conditions. Digestive enzymatic activity of S. senegalensis larvae was also affected by future predictions. Hypercapnic conditions led to a decrease in the activity of digestive enzymes, both pancreatic (up to 26.1 \% for trypsin and 74.5 \% for amylase) and intestinal enzymes (up to 36.1 \% for alkaline phosphatase) in post-metamorphic larvae. Moreover, the impact of ocean acidification and warming on some of these physiological and biochemical variables (namely, lower OCR and higher HSP and MDA levels) were translated into larvae performance, being significantly correlated with decreased larval growth and survival or increased incidence of skeletal deformities. The increased vulnerability of flatfish early life stages under future ocean conditions is expected to potentially determine recruitment and population dynamics in marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Even in the absence of major disturbances (e.g., cyclones, bleaching), corals are subject to high levels of partial or whole-colony mortality, often caused by chronic and small-scale disturbances. Depending on levels of background mortality, these chronic disturbances may undermine individual fitness and have significant consequences on the ability of colonies to withstand subsequent acute disturbances or environmental change. This study quantified intraspecific variations in physiological condition (measured based on total lipid content and zooxanthellae density) through time in adult colonies of two common and widespread coral species (Acropora spathulata and Pocillopora damicornis), subject to different levels of biological and physical disturbances along the most disturbed reef habitat, the crest. Marked intraspecific variation in the physiological condition of A. spathulata was clearly linked to differences in local disturbance regimes and habitat. Specifically, zooxanthellae density decreased (r2 = 26, df = 5,42, p\textexclamdown 0.02, B = -121255, p = 0.03) and total lipid content increased (r 2 = 14, df = 5,42, p = 0.01, B = 0.9, p = 0.01) with increasing distance from exposed crests. Moreover, zooxanthellae density was strongly and negatively correlated with the individual level of partial mortality (r 2 = 26, df = 5,42, p\textexclamdown 0.02, B = -7386077, p = 0.01). Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited very limited intraspecific variation in physiological condition, despite marked differences in levels of partial mortality. This is the first study to relate intraspecific variation in the condition of corals to localized differences in chronic disturbance regimes. The next step is to ascertain whether these differences have further ramifications for susceptibility to periodic acute disturbances, such as climate-induced coral bleaching. \textcopyright{} 2014 Pisapia et al.}

  abstract = {Even in the absence of major disturbances (e.g., cyclones and bleaching), corals are consistently subject to high levels of background mortality, which undermines individual fitness and resilience of coral colonies. Most studies of coral mortality however only focus on catastrophic mortality associated with major acute disturbance events, neglecting to consider background levels of chronic mortality that have a significant influence on population structure and turnover. If, for example, there are geographic differences in the prevalence of injuries and rates of background mortality, coral communities may vary in their susceptibility to acute large-scale disturbances and environmental change. This study quantified the prevalence and severity of partial mortality for four dominant and widespread coral taxa (massive Porites, encrusting Montipora, Acropora hyacinthus, and branching Pocillopora) at Lhaviyani Atoll, Maldives, and on the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The prevalence and severity of sublethal injuries varied greatly among taxa, but was generally similar between locations; on the Great Barrier Reef, 99.4 \% Porites colonies, 66 \% of A. hyacinthus, and 64 \% of Pocillopora had conspicuous injuries, compared to 92.4 \% of Porites, 47.5 \% of A. hyacinthus, and 44 \% of Pocillopora colonies in Lhaviyani Atoll. These results suggest that background rates of mortality and injury, and associated resilience of coral populations and communities to large-scale disturbances, are conserved at large geographic scales, though adjacent colonies can have markedly different injury regimes, likely to lead to strong intraspecific variation in colony fitness and resilience. \textcopyright{} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

Here, we describe changes in abundance (ABD) and morphotype (MTs) diversity of rotifer resting eggs in the sediments of deep subalpine Lake Orta, Italy, covering a period prior to (pre-) 1926, during long-term ammonia and metal pollution from a rayon factory, and subsequent recovery of water quality. Following the pollution and bacterial oxidation of the ammonia, Lake Orta became the largest and deepest acid lake in Europe. Recovery of water quality followed both a ban on the discharge of industrial wastes, and a liming intervention in 1989 and 1990. We sectioned a sediment core collected from the deepest part of the lake (ORTA 07/2A) to provide a high  time resolution, given the ca. 3-4 y cm{$^{-1}$} of sediment accumulation. Rotifer resting egg (RRE) abundance and morphotypes were examined from the sediments and compared to limnological variables indicating the pollution. Rotifer resting egg abundance significantly increased with lake contamination (r=0.609 and -0.624 for copper and pH, respectively; P\&lt;0.001; n=27). A lake-water copper concentration threshold of ca. 40 \textmu g L{$^{-1}$}discriminated among pre-, during-, and post- pollution compositions of the rotifer morphotype assemblages. Diversity and morphotype richness increased during the recovery from copper pollution and with complete restoration from acidity, while abundance increased during pollution. The persistence of presumably viable {$<$}em{$>$}Brachionus{$<$}/em{$>$} resting eggs and of hatched egg cases during the heavy pollution phase suggests that, unlike most other organisms, which were extirpated by the pollution of the lake, rotifers survived producing resting eggs, which secured future generations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Whether these organisms are all physiologically adapted to stand a large temperature gradient or stenotherms with narrow growth temperature ranges has so far remained unexplored. We submitted a panel of six strains, isolated along a gradient of latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean, to long- and short-term variations of temperature. Upon a downward shift of temperature, the strains showed strikingly distinct resistance, seemingly related to their latitude of isolation, with tropical strains collapsing while northern strains were capable of growing. This behaviour was associated to differential photosynthetic performances. In the tropical strains, the rapid photosystem II inactivation and the decrease of the antioxydant {$\beta$}-carotene relative to chl a suggested a strong induction of oxidative stress. These different responses were related to the thermal preferenda of the strains. The northern strains could grow at 10 C while the other strains preferred higher temperatures. In addition, we pointed out a correspondence between strain isolation temperature and phylogeny. In particular, clades I and IV laboratory strains were all collected in the coldest waters of the distribution area of marine Synechococus. We, however, show that clade I Synechococcus exhibit different levels of adaptation, which apparently reflect their location on the latitudinal temperature gradient. This study reveals the existence of lineages of marine Synechococcus physiologically specialised in different thermal niches, therefore suggesting the existence of temperature ecotypes within the marine Synechococcus radiation. \textcopyright{} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus play a key role in global oceanic primary productivity. Their wide latitudinal distribution has been attributed to the occurrence of lineages adapted to distinct thermal niches, but the physiological and molecular bases of this ecotypic differentiation remain largely unknown. By comparing six strains isolated from different latitudes, we showed that the thermostability of their light-harvesting complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), varied according to the average sea surface temperature at strain isolation site. Comparative analyses of thermal unfolding curves of the three phycobiliproteins (PBP) constituting PBS rods suggested that the differences in thermostability observed on whole PBSs relied on the distinct molecular flexibility and stability of their individual components. Phycocyanin was the least thermostable of all rod PBP, constituting a fragility point of the PBS under heat stress. Amino-acid composition analyses and structural homology modeling notably revealed the occurrence of two amino-acid substitutions, which might have a role in the observed differential thermotolerance of this phycobiliprotein among temperature ecotypes. We hypothesize that marine Synechococcus ancestors occurred first in warm niches and that during the colonization of cold, high latitude thermal niches, their descendants have increased the molecular flexibility of PBP to maintain optimal light absorption capacities, this phenomenon likely resulting in a decreased stability of these proteins. This apparent thermoadaptability of marine Synechococcus has most probably contributed to the remarkable ubiquity of these picocyanobacteria in the ocean.},

Functional recovery and resilience to pesticides were enhanced in nutrient-enriched systems, whereas compositional recovery was generally not achieved. Pesticides did not affect compositional DS, whereas functional DS was significantly increased by the insecticide only in non-enriched systems. Stressor interactions acted non-additively on single stability dimensions as well as on functional DS. Moreover we demonstrate that pesticides can modify the correlation between functional and compositional aspects of stability. Our study shows that different disturbance types, and their interactions, require specific management actions to promote ecosystem stability.},

  abstract = {Assemblages of corals, sponges, foraminifera, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea were assessed at two depths in the Spermonde Archipelago. Our goal was to assess to what extent variation in composition could be explained by habitat and water quality variables. The habitat variables consisted of depth, substrate type and scleractinian coral cover while water quality variables were derived from ocean color satellite imagery, including the colored dissolved organic matter index (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chlor-a) and remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm (Rrs{$_6$}45). Together, habitat and water quality variables explained from 31\% (sediment bacteria) to 80\% (forams) of the variation in composition. The variation in composition of corals, sponges, forams and sediment archaea was primarily related to habitat variables, while the variation in composition of sediment bacteria was primarily related to water quality variables. Habitat and water quality variables explained similar amounts of variation in the composition of corals and sediment bacteria. CDOM (sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea), Chlor-a (corals and forams) and Rrs{$_6$}45 (sponges and forams) proved significant predictors of variation in composition for the studied taxa. In addition to water quality variables, all taxa responded to a range of habitat variables including depth and the percentage cover of various benthic life forms including coral cover variables, rubble and sand. Sand cover was the most important habitat variable for corals, sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea. Coral life forms including the cover of branching and tabular corals were important habitat variables for sponges and forams. These results show marked differences in how various taxa respond to variation in habitat and water quality in the Spermonde Archipelago. Moreover, our results indicate that variables estimated from ocean color satellite imagery proved to be better predictors of variation in marine community composition than commonly-used proxies such as the distance offshore or distance to the nearest river.},

It is estimated that the low surface chlorophyll areas in these oceans combined have expanded by 6.6 million km(2) or by about 15.0\% from 1998 through 2006. In both hemispheres, evidence shows a more rapid expansion of the low surface chlorophyll waters during the winter. The North Atlantic, which has the smallest oligotrophic gyre is expanding most rapidly, both annually at 4.3\%/yr and seasonally, in the first quarter at 8.5\%/yr. Mean sea surface temperature in each of these 4 subtropical gyres also increased over the 9-year period. The expansion of the low chlorophyll waters is consistent with global warming scenarios based on increased vertical stratification in the mid-latitudes, but the rates of expansion we observe already greatly exceed recent model predictions.},

In this study, we compared functional traits of 38 tropical tree species from dry and moist forest, and quantified their ability to survive drought in a dry-down experiment in which wilting and survival were monitored. We evaluated how seedling traits affect drought survival, and how drought survival determines species distribution along the rainfall gradient. Dry forest species tended to have compound leaves, high stem dry matter content (stem dry mass/fresh mass), and low leaf area ratio, suggesting that reduction of transpiration and avoidance of xylem cavitation are important for their success. Three functional groups were identified based on the seedling traits: (1) drought avoiders with a deciduous leaf habitat and taproots; (2) drought resisters with tough tissues (i.e., a high dry matter content); and (3) light-demanding moist forest species with a large belowground foraging capacity. Dry forest species had a longer drought survival time (62 d) than moist forest species (25 d). Deciduousness explained 69 percent of interspecific variation in drought survival. Among evergreen species, stem density explained 20 percent of the drought survival. Drought survival was not related to species distribution along the rainfall gradient, because it was mainly determined by deciduousness, and species with deciduous seedlings are found in both dry and moist forests. Among evergreen species, drought survival explained 28 percent of the variation in species position along the rainfall gradient. This suggests that, apart from drought tolerance, other factors such as history, dispersal limitation, shade tolerance, and fire shape species distribution patterns along the rainfall gradient. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Ocean warming "hotspots" are regions characterised by above-average temperature increases over recent years, for which there are significant consequences for both living marine resources and the societies that depend on them. As such, they represent early warning systems for understanding the impacts of marine climate change, and test-beds for developing adaptation options for coping with those impacts. Here, we examine five hotspots off the coasts of eastern Australia, South Africa, Madagascar, India and Brazil. These particular hotspots have underpinned a large international partnership that is working towards improving community adaptation by characterizing, assessing and projecting the likely future of coastal-marine food resources through the provision and sharing of knowledge. To inform this effort, we employ a high resolution global ocean model forced by Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and simulated to year 2099. In addition to the sea surface temperature, we analyse projected stratification, nutrient supply, primary production, anthropogenic CO2 -driven ocean acidification, deoxygenation and ocean circulation. Our simulation finds that that the temperature-defined hotspots studied here will continue to experience warming but, with the exception of eastern Australia, may not remain the fastest warming ocean areas over the next century as the strongest warming is projected to occur in the subpolar and polar areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, we find that recent rapid change in SST is not necessarily an indicator that these areas are also hotspots of the other climatic stressors examined. However, a consistent facet of the hotspots studied here is that they are all strongly influenced by ocean circulation, which has already shown changes in the recent past and is projected to undergo further strong change into the future. In addition to the fast warming, change in local ocean circulation represents a distinct feature of present and future climate change impacting marine ecosystems in these areas.

  abstract = {Ocean warming and acidification occur at global scales and, in the case of temperature, have already caused shifts in marine ecosystem composition and function. In the case of CO2-induced ocean hypercapnia and acidification, however, effects may still be so small that evidence for changes in the field is largely lacking, Future scenarios indicate that marine life forms are threatened by the specific or synergistic effects of factors involved in these processes. The present paper builds on the view that development of a cause and effect understanding is required beyond empirical observations, for a more accurate projection of ecosystem effects and for quantitative scenarios. Identification of the mechanisms through which temperature- and CO2-related ocean physicochemistry affect organism fitness, survival and success, is crucial with this research strategy. I suggest operation of unifying physiological principles, not only of temperature but also CO2 effects, across animal groups and phyla. Thermal windows of optimized performance emerge as a basic character defining species fitness and survival, including their capacity to interact with other species. Through effects on performance at the level of reproduction, behaviour and growth, ocean acidification acts especially on lower marine invertebrates, which are characterized by a low capacity to compensate for disturbances in extracellular ion and acid-base status and sensitivity of metabolism to such disturbances. Available data suggest that one key consequence of these features is a narrowing of thermal tolerance windows, as well as a reduced scope for performance at ecosystem level. These changes in bioenvelopes may have major implications for the ranges of geographical distribution of these organisms and in species interactions.},

Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},

Given the large range of genotypes that can be generated per species through artificial selection, genetic diversity is a potentially important leverage of productivity in cultivated systems. Here we assess the effect of species and genetic diversity on the production and sustainable supply of livestock fodder in sown grasslands, comprising single and multispecies assemblages characterized by different levels of genetic diversity, exposed to drought and non-drought conditions. Multispecies assemblages proved more productive than monocultures when subject to drought, regardless of the number of genotypes per species present. Conversely, the temporal stability of production increased only with the number of genotypes present under both drought and non-drought conditions, and was unaffected by the number of species. We conclude that taxonomic and genetic diversity can play complementary roles when it comes to optimizing livestock fodder production in managed grasslands, and suggest that both levels of diversity should be considered in plant breeding programmes designed to boost the productivity and resilience of managed grasslands in the face of increasing environmental hazards.},

The increase in lipid peroxidation and catalase activities suggest hypercapnia induced oxidative stress. The decreasing pH also increased the activity of reduced glutathione and glutathione S transferase which acts as detoxifying enzymes for Hypercapnia induced toxicity however the hypercapnic conditions inhibited the levels of acetylcholine esterase which indicates the polluted environment substantiating stress induced high rate of mortality at low pH levels.

  abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator-theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: (1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems; (2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big data and machine learning techniques; and (3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {The essence of comparative physiology is the use of the kind of organism as one experimental variable. Comparison of the physiology of animal phyla, classes and orders has elucidated many important generalizations, for example, the distribution of muscle phosphagens, of blood pigments, forms of nitrogen excretion, cholinergic regulation of hearts, and others ; relationships earlier claimed on morphological grounds have found support. Variation of the physiological characters of species and subspecies has rarely been studied systematically. Yet taxonomists and ecologists base their conclusions regarding evolutionary mechanisms on variation within species and subspecies, and comparison of physiological adaptations should contri- bute much to an understanding of interspecific relations, intraspecific variation, and the bases for ecological ranges. The selective value of new genetic patterns depends on functional adaptation, and sometimes the morphological characters which are useful in systematics may not be necessarily adaptive in themselves but may be outward signs, associated by linkage or pleiotropism with subtle physiological characters. Whether a new variation can permit extension of the range of a species depends on whether it confers capacity adaptive to environmental stress.},

  abstract = {Translocation of non-indigenous species is a global threat to the structure and func- tioning of coastal ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems and estuaries are particularly prone for invasions due to impacts from a variety of anthropogenic stressors and frequent propagule pressure, notably from shipping. In addition, species poor environments, especially when already impacted by multiple anthropogenic stressors, such as the Baltic Sea, are thought to be particularly susceptible to invasions. In the Baltic Sea, to date more than 130 non-indigenous species have been reported and about 80 have been able to become established. Few have become invasive, spreading rapidly and/or begun to impact the native ecosystem. In this thesis the aim was to study how invasive benthic non- indigenous species, specifically the Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) have settled in their new environment, how they have affected the ecosystem and how this information of the species can in future be used in management practices (e.g., risk assessments) in the Baltic Sea. The results show that the interactions between the two non-indigenous species and the environment are highly complex and may involve both generic and strictly context-specific components. The native predators and parasites in the area have begun to exploit the new species, although they are currently unable to control the growing mud crab and round goby populations. Furthermore, the FISK (Fish Invasiveness Scoring Kit) risk assessment exercise for the southern coastal areas of Finland showed that many non-indigenous fish species, some of which have already established, do have potential for becoming pests in the area. However, the continuously changing environment (incl. due to climate change) modi- fies both the non-indigenous and invasive biota in the area as well as may alter the nature and magnitude of ecosystem changes caused by the non-indigenous species. The infor- mation gathered in the thesis can be used in further risk assessments and aiding future management decisions. Keywords:},

They usually occupy different habitats (e.g. shallow versus deep water) at a local scale, while occurring in the same broad regions at a large scale. The present study assesses the extent to which the habitat partitioning observed at local scales extends to niche partitioning at the global scale. 2. Species distribution models (SDMs, using MaxEnt) were used to model the potential distributions of both species based on a set of environmental and dispersal related predictors. 3. According to environmental SDMs calibrated with bioclimatic, geographic and geological factors, only 75\% of the predicted quagga mussel distribution overlaps with the distribution of zebra mussel, demonstrating that the niches of the two species are moderately different at a global scale. 4. Quagga mussels were found to occur at higher average temperature and lower average precipitation, leading to the prediction that their niche includes Mediterranean and arid regions such as California and southern Spain, two areas currently unaffected by zebra mussel. 5. A second set of SDMs illustrated a notable influence of dispersal-related factors (e.g. human population density, closeness to commercial ports and reservoirs), on quagga mussel distribution. These models suggest that the distribution of quagga mussel is more constrained by dispersal-related factors than is the distribution of zebra mussel. 6. Evidence suggests that economic and environmental impacts can differ between the two species; joint accurate predictions may therefore prove important for targeting precautionary management plans at the right species.},

  abstract = {Geodia barretti is a marine cold-water sponge harbouring high numbers of microorganisms. Significant rates of nitrification have been observed in this sponge, indicating a substantial contribution to nitrogen turnover in marine environments with high sponge cover. In order to get closer insights into the phylogeny and function of the active microbial community and the interaction with its host G. barretti, a metatranscriptomic approach was employed, using the simultaneous analysis of rRNA and mRNA. Of the 262 298 RNA-tags obtained by pyrosequencing, 92\% were assigned to ribosomal RNA (ribo-tags). A total of 109 325 SSU rRNA ribo-tags revealed a detailed picture of the community, dominated by group SAR202 of Chloroflexi, candidate phylum Poribacteria and Acidobacteria, which was different in its composition from that obtained in clone libraries prepared form the same samples. Optimized assembly strategies allowed the reconstruction of full-length rRNA sequences from the short ribo-tags for more detailed phylogenetic studies of the dominant taxa. Cells of several phyla were visualized by FISH analyses for confirmation. Of the remaining 21 325 RNA-tags, 10 023 were assigned to mRNA-tags, based on similarities to genes in the databases. A wide range of putative functional gene transcripts from over 10 different phyla were identified among the bacterial mRNA-tags. The most abundant mRNAs were those encoding key metabolic enzymes of nitrification from ammonia-oxidizing archaea as well as candidate genes involved in related processes. Our analysis demonstrates the potential and limits of using a combined rRNA and mRNA approach to explore the microbial community profile, phylogenetic assignments and metabolic activities of a complex, but little explored microbial community.},

Quantifying ecological stability therefore requires inspecting multiple stability properties, such as resistance, recovery, persistence and invariability. Correlations among these properties can reduce the dimensionality of stability, simplifying the study of environmental effects on ecosystems. A key question is how the kind of disturbance affects these correlations. We here investigated the effect of three disturbance types (random, species-specific, local) applied at four intensity levels, on the dimensionality of stability at the population and community level. We used previously parameterized models that represent five natural communities, varying in species richness and the number of trophic levels. We found that disturbance type but not intensity affected the dimensionality of stability and only at the population level. The dimensionality of stability also varied greatly among species and communities. Therefore, studying stability cannot be simplified to using a single metric and multi-dimensional assessments are still to be recommended.},

Here we address three critical ones: selecting appropriate evaluation data, detecting overfitting, and tuning program settings to approximate optimal model complexity. We integrate solutions to these issues for Maxent models, using the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse, Heteromys anomalus, as an example. Location: North-western South America. Methods We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities). Then, we carried out tuning experiments by varying the level of regularization, which controls model complexity. Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography. Results Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations. Main conclusions Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data. These strategies for model evaluation may be useful for other modelling methods as well.},

  abstract = {Species' distribution models (SDMs) attempt to predict the potential distribution of species by interpolating identified relationships between species' presence/ absence, or presence-only data on one hand, and environmental predictors on the other hand, to a geographical area of interest. Currently, they are widely applied in biogeography, conservation biology, ecology, palaeo-ecology, invasive species studies, and wildlife management (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Ara\'ujo and Pearson 2005, Thuiller et al. 2005, Peterson 2006, Ara\'ujo and Guisan 2006, Guisan et al. 2006). More recently, vast numbers of herbarium and natural history museum collections have become available (Graham et al. 2004) and techniques to apply this special type of presence-only data have been developed (Hirzel et al. 2002, Anderson et al. 2003, Pearce and Boyce 2006, Elith et al. 2006, Phillips et al. 2006). Despite the widespread use of SDMs, several high-priority research interests remain to be investigated (Guisan and Thuiller 2005, Ara\'ujo and Guisan 2006). One of these is the improvement of SDM validation, or the quantification of a model's predictive performance (Ara\'ujo and Guisan 2006). The fact that the standard validation procedures for an SDM are not sufficient to assess the applicability of an SDM in a predictive context, was first shown by Olden et al. (2002). They showed that after SDM validation it is critical to assess whether the SDM prediction differs from what would be expected on the basis of chance alone. SDMs producing random predictions are neither helpful nor useful (Olden et al. 2002). Thus, in this paper we introduce a null-model methodology that allows testing whether SDMs devel- oped with presence-only data differ significantly from what would be expected by chance. We also demonstrate that it is critical and possible to correct for collector-bias in specimen data in this test.},

Using empirical examples on vertebrates, arthropods, and microbes, we highlight that key functional traits can be linked to dispersal. We argue that this coupling between dispersal and functional traits can have consequences for meta-ecosystem functioning, mediating flows of functional traits and thus the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem functions. As dispersal syndromes may be genetically determined, the spatial heterogeneity of functional traits may be further carried over across generations and link meta-ecosystem functioning to evolutionary dynamics.},

While estimates from growth curves are simple and allow high throughput, they are inaccurate and do not account for interactions between costs and benefits accruing over different parts of a growth cycle. For this reason, pairwise competition experiments are the current ``gold standard'' for accurate estimation of fitness. However, competition experiments require distinct markers, making them difficult to perform between isolates derived from a common ancestor or between isolates of nonmodel organisms. In addition, competition experiments require that competing strains be grown in the same environment, so they cannot be used to infer the fitness consequence of different environmental perturbations on the same genotype. Finally, competition experiments typically consider only the end-points of a period of competition so that they do not readily provide information on the growth differences that underlie competitive ability. Here, we describe a computational approach for predicting density-dependent microbial growth in a mixed culture utilizing data from monoculture and mixed-culture growth curves. We validate this approach using 2 different experiments with Escherichia coli and demonstrate its application for estimating relative fitness. Our approach provides an effective way to predict growth and infer relative fitness in mixed cultures.},

Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular.

While invasive species often threaten biodiversity and human well-being, their potential to enhance functioning by offsetting the loss of native habitat has rarely been considered. We manipulated the abundance of the nonnative, habitat-forming seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla in large plots (25 m 2 ) on southeastern US intertidal landscapes to assess impacts on multiple ecosystem functions underlying coastal ecosystem services. We document that in the absence of native habitat formers, this invasion has an overall positive, density-dependent impact across a diverse set of ecosystem processes (e.g., abundance and richness of nursery taxa, flow attenuation). Manipulation of invader abundance revealed both thresholds and saturations in the provisioning of ecosystem functions. Taken together, these findings call into question the focus of traditional invasion research and management that assumes negative effects of nonnatives, and emphasize the need to consider context-dependence and integrative measurements when assessing the impact of an invader, including density dependence, multifunctionality, and the status of native habitat formers. This work supports discussion of the idea that where native foundation species have been lost, invasive habitat formers may be considered as sources of valuable ecosystem functions.},

  abstract = {A key challenge of ecosystem management is determining how to manage multiple ecosystem services across landscapes. Enhancing important provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixeduse landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles and were able to link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social-ecological dynamics. Our results show landscapescale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services. Ecosystem service-bundle analysis can identify areas on a landscape where ecosystem management has produced exceptionally desirable or undesirable sets of ecosystem services.},

An equation derived through an analogy with allosteric enzyme kinetics is given which will account for both Type II and Type III responses. The response behavior can be explained by three parameters: maximal feeding rate (F); an affinity constant (G) related to handling times, capture efficiencies, etc.; and the number of encounters (n) a predator must have with a prey item before becoming maximally efficient at utilizing the prey item as a resource. A discussion follows on the biological processes which result in shifts from Type II to Type III functional responses. Most of the learning processes involve changes in predator behavior associated with increasing encounters with prey, thus supporting parameter n as a major determinant in shifting thc functional response. Three hypotheses concerning the values parameters F, G, and n will assume under different ecological situations are posited: (l) food preferences will be reflected in an increase in resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G) and a decrease in values of n encounters; (2) a size ordering of the predators will result in shifts up in the resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G); while (3) increasing habitat complexity will generate decreases in n and F.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling \textendash{} movement among patches or local populations \textendash{} is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation. We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to movements, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for modularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites. We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these different types of movements. Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Furthermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple movement phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the limiting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for interpreting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

Increasing intraspecific diversity with cultivar mixtures is one way to increase diversity in agricultural systems. We examined the relationship between intraspecific diversity and yield in cultivar mixtures using a meta-analysis of 91 studies and \textquestiondown 3600 observations. Additionally, we investigated how environmental and management factors might influence this relationship, and if the yield stability of cultivar mixtures differed from that of monocultures. We found that the yield increased by 2.2\% overall in cultivar mixtures relative to their monoculture components. Mixtures with more cultivars and those with more functional trait diversity showed higher relative yields. Under biotic stressors, such as disease pressure, and abiotic stressors, such as low levels of soil organic matter and nutrient availability, this diversity effect was stronger, resulting in higher relative yields. Finally, cultivar mixtures generally showed higher yield stability compared to monocultures, especially in response to annual weather variability at a site over time. This practice of mixing cultivars can be integrated into intensified cropping systems where species monocultures dominate, as well as in smallholder cropping systems where low-cost improvements are in demand. Overall, these results suggest that cultivar mixtures are a viable strategy to increase diversity in agroecosystems, promoting increased yield and yield stability, with minimal environmental impact.},

Several studies have examined the effects of heat waves and turbidity separately, whereas this study analysed the individual effects of both stressors as well as their interaction, because stressors affect communities differently when acting in combination. Using a factorial experimental design, we simulated heat waves (22 \textdegree C and 26 \textdegree C compared to an 18 \textdegree C control) and turbidity (sediment addition). The response of the phytoplankton community was analysed for the aggregate parameters biovolume and diversity index (H'), as well as for community composition. Heat waves had a significant negative effect on biovolume, whereas turbidity tended to affect biovolume positively. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant interactions of heat waves and turbidity for H' and community composition. Strong heat waves (26 \textdegree C) alleviated the otherwise positive effect of turbidity on H', i.e. highest diversity remained in the turbid control. Diatoms gained dominance in the control and the 22 \textdegree C heat wave treatment with Cylindrotheca closterium being the successful competitor. At 26 \textdegree C this species was lost and small flagellates dominated the experimental communities. Future increases in heat wave intensity and frequency may thus induce major changes in phytoplankton community structure whereas algae might profit from increased turbidity as an additional source of nutrients.},

While phenotypic plasticity is usually considered costly, local adaptation takes generations to respond to environmental change and may be constrained by strong gene flow. The majority of marine species have complex life-cycles with pelagic stages that might be expected to promote gene flow and plastic responses, and yet several notable examples of local adaptation have been found in species with broadcast larvae. In the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1767),-a common marine species with broadcast spawning and a short larval stage-previous studies have found marked differences in salinity tolerance of early life-history stages among populations from different salinity regimes. We used common-garden experiments to test whether observed differences in salinity tolerance could be explained by phenotypic plasticity. Adult ascidians from two low salinity populations [2-5 m depth, \textasciitilde 25 practical salinity units (PSU)], and two full salinity populations (25-27 m depth, \textasciitilde 31 PSU) were acclimated for 2-4 weeks at both 25 and 31 PSU. Gametes were fertilized at the acclimation salinities, and the newly formed embryos were transferred to 10 different salinities (21-39 PSU) and cultured to metamorphosis. Adult acclimation salinity had an overriding and significant effect on larval metamorphic success: tolerance norms for larvae almost fully matched the acclimation salinity of the parents, independent of parental origin (deep or shallow). However we also detected minor population differences that could be attributed to either local adaptation or persistent environmental effects. We conclude that differences in salinity tolerance of C. intestinalis larvae from different populations are driven primarily by transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, a strategy that seems particularly favourable for an organism living in coastal waters where salinity is less readily predicted than in the open oceans. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The book series ADVANCES IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION Including Bioenergy and Related Processes provides a comprehensive and state-of-the-art account of research in photosynthesis, respiration and related processes. Virtually all life on our planet Earth ultimately depends on photosynthetic energy capture and conversion to energy-rich organic molecules. These are used for food, fuel, and fi ber. Photosynthesis is the source of almost all bioenergy on Earth. The fuel and energy uses of photosynthesized products and processes have become an important area of study and competition between food and fuel has led to resurgence in photosynthesis research. This series of books spans topics from physics to agronomy and medicine; from femtosecond processes through season-long production to evolutionary changes over the course of the history of the Earth; from the photophysics of light absorption, excitation energy transfer in the antenna to the reaction centers, where the highly-efficient primary conversion of light energy to charge separation occurs, through the electrochemistry of intermediate electron transfer, to the physiology of whole organisms and ecosystems; and from X-ray crystallography of proteins to the morphology of organelles and intact organisms. In addition to photosynthesis in natural systems, genetic engineering of photosynthesis and artifi cial photosynthesis is included in this series. The goal of the series is to offer beginning researchers, advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and even research specialists, a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the remarkable advances across the full scope of research on photosynthesis and related energy processes. The purpose of this series is to improve understanding of photosynthesis and plant respiration at many levels both to improve basic understanding of these important processes and to enhance our ability to use photosynthesis for the improvement of the human condition.},

  author = {Reyns, Wouter},

  month = mar,
  abstract = {Natural ecosystems store large quantities of carbon in their soils, thereby preventing it from ending up in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. A key question is whether climate change increases or decreases the capacity of soils to sequester carbon, and hence whether ecosystems will buffer or accelerate climate change. However, experimentally in situ observed changes in soil carbon contents under climate change simulations are very variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Heathlands are rare, seminatural ecosystems with soils dominated by fungi and relatively high carbon sequestration rates. These systems might thus play an important role in our understanding of the effects of climate change on soil carbon sequestration. Therefore, in this PhD, we investigate how heathland soil fungi are affected by climate change, as changes in soil fungal functioning to a large extent drive the observed changes in heathland soil carbon sequestration. In Chapter 1, the difficulty to parameterize a simple mechanistic food web model that simulates the effect of climate change on soil carbon sequestration indicated that we currently lack basic empirical data on species interactions and stress tolerances. Therefore, we focused in the thesis on the stress ecology of and interactions between fungi, as they are the most important group of organisms with respect to carbon sequestration in heathland soils. But in order to expose heathland soil fungi to abiotic stressors in laboratory experiments, we had to isolate as many fungal species as possible. Therefore, in Chapter 2, we tested four methods and seven growth media for their efficiency in isolating soil fungi. All four tested isolation methods, that have largely varying methodologies, showed high taxon specificity and complementarity. Contrary to expectations, the nutrient composition of the growth medium did not affect cultivation. However, long incubation times did prove to be useful for the isolation of additional fungal taxa. Hence, by using various isolation methods combined with long incubation times, we were able to cultivate a relatively diverse soil fungal community. In Chapter 3, we in vitro quantified the tolerance to temperature and water stress (drought) of the isolated fungal taxa by assessing their growth under different treatments. Additionally, we measured several functional traits, such as Summary v melanin content, that are considered to be important direct mechanistic drivers of their tolerance to these abiotic stressors. We found a large variability in stress sensitivities among taxa, whereby fungi were in general tolerant to the applied mild temperature and water stress, but sensitive to high temperature stress. These heathland soil fungi are thus relatively well-adapted to harsh abiotic conditions. Contrary to expectations, the measured functional traits did not explain the variation in abiotic stress tolerance among taxa, which is thus probably driven by other traits than those that we quantified In Chapter 4, we investigated how these abiotic stressors affect the capacity of fungi to grow in presence of a more abundant competitor, which we defined as biotic stress tolerance. We found that fungal growth rates were positively affected by biotic stress under benign conditions, but that interactions between fungi become negative under high warming stress, opposite to the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH). Tolerance to biotic stress was not driven by tolerance to abiotic stress nor intrinsic growth rate of the fungus, at any level of abiotic stress. These results suggest that global change could potentially impact fungal communities in unpredictable ways. Several perspectives would validate and further complement the gathered knowledge, by addressing how the observed changes in fungal growth rates under biotic and abiotic stress propagate into more complex set-ups and more complex communities and eventually translate into changes in soil carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {Thermal performance curves are widely used to describe how ambient temperature impacts different attributes of ectothermic organisms, from protein function to life-history traits, and to predict the potential effects of global warming on ecological systems. Nonetheless, from an analytical standpoint, they remain primarily heuristic and few attempts have been made to develop a formal framework to characterize these curves and disentangle which factors contribute to their variation. Here we employ a nonlinear regression approach to assess if they vary systematically in shape depending on the performance proxy of choice. We compare curves at contrasting levels of organization, namely photosynthetic rates in plants ( n = 43), running speeds in lizards ( n = 51) and intrinsic rates of population increase in insects ( n = 47), and show with discriminant analyses that differences lie in a single dimension accounting for 99.1\% of the variation, resulting in 75.8\% of classification accuracy. Differences revolve primarily around the thermal range for elevated performance (greater than or equal to 50\% of maximum performance), which is broader for photosynthetic rates (median of 26.4\textdegree C), intermediate for running speeds (19.5\textdegree C) and narrower for intrinsic rates of increase (12.5\textdegree C). We contend, confounding taxonomic factors aside, that these differences reflect contrasting levels of biological organization, and hypothesize that the thermal range for elevated performance should decrease at higher organization levels. In this scenario, instantaneous or short-term measures of performance may grossly overestimate the thermal safety margins for population growth and reproduction. Taken together, our analyses suggest that descriptors of the curve are highly correlated and respond in tandem, potentially resulting in systematic variation in shape across organization levels. Future studies should take into consideration this potential bias, address if it constitutes a general pattern and, if so, explain why and how it emerges.

Though they are believed to be capable of infecting all phytoplankton species their role in regulating plankton population levels is not well understood. In order to gain an understanding of the potential influence of viruses on phytoplankton population dynamics, particularly 'blooms', two plankton ecosystem models with explicit representation of viruses and virally infected phytoplankton are presented, and an initial investigation into their range of behaviours explored. The models are extensions of well-established plankton ecosystem models that now permit the possibility of viral infection and mortality of phytoplankton. Ecological and epidemiological parameters from a number of sources are used to furnish the models. The models are shown to be capable of capturing known features of phytoplankton population dynamics in the presence of viruses: viruses can stably co-exist in the plankton ecosystem without the need to invoke other stabilising processes, and infection can serve to suppress primary production and phytoplankton abundance whilst boosting nutrient levels. Intuitively, viral infection will be most effective when phytoplankton is high. We therefore use the two models to investigate the influence of viral infection on 'blooms' in two independent ways: first with a seasonally-forced variability and second with a triggered transient event. It is demonstrated that the impact of viruses can be very noticeable during episodes of enhanced phytoplankton density found during 'blooms'. Viruses serve to attenuate the intensity and duration of these transient events in a manner consistent with observations. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

They play an important role in biogeochemical cycles as well as being implicated in observed patterns of species abundance and diversity. The influence of viral infection in plankton ecosystems is not fully understood. Here we use a number of well-founded mathematical models to investigate the interplay of the ecological and epidemiological interactions of plankton and viruses in the sea. Of particular interest is the role of nutrient on the population dynamics. Nutrient forcing has been suggested as a means of absorbing excess anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide by stimulating increased phytoplankton primary productivity. Here we show that enriching nutrient levels in the sea may decrease the amount of infected phytoplankton species thereby additionally enhancing the efficiency of the biological pump, a means by which carbon is transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Ocean acidification is increasing and affects many marine organisms. However, certain sponge species can withstand low-pH conditions. This may be related to their complex association with microbes. We hypothesized that species with greater microbial diversity may develop functional redundancy that could enable the holobiont to survive even if particular microbes are lost at low-pH conditions. We evaluated the effects of acidification on the growth and associated microbes of three ubiquitous Mediterranean sponges by exposing them to the present pH level and that predicted for the year 2100. We found marked differences among the species in the acquisition of new microbes, being high in Dysidea avara, moderate in Agelas oroides and null in Chondrosia reniformis; however, we did not observe variation in the overall microbiome abundance, richness or diversity. The relative abilities to alter the microbiomes contributes to survivorship in an OA scenario as demonstrated by lowered pH severely affecting the growth of C. reniformis, halving that of A. oroides, and unaffecting D. avara. Our results indicate that functional stability of the sponge holobiont to withstand future OA is species-specific and is linked to the species' ability to use horizontal transmission to modify the associated microbiome to adapt to environmental change.},

Using a large number of polymorphic genetic markers, we were able to test this assumption for two salt marsh plants known to span extreme salinity gradients. For both species, clonal diversity was surprisingly high across populations: Simpson's diversity indices were 0.96 and 0.99. Although clonal diversity was high, there was no pattern of association between specific clones or alleles with salt microhabitat. Our findings suggest that sexual reproduction and recruitment from seeds may have been generally underappreciated as an important ecological force in the salt marsh. Furthermore, clonal diversity has implications for conservation and restoration of these critical coastal habitats, particularly with regard to buffering environmental change or disease. Recent studies also suggest that high levels of intraspecific diversity can affect a variety of community and ecosystem processes.},

However, the responses to multiple stressors, such as those above, are often complex and there is contradictory evidence as to how they may interact. Here we used broad scale data from 494 lakes in central and northern Europe, to assess how cyanobacteria respond to nutrients (phosphorus), temperature and water retention time in different types of lakes. Eight lake types were examined based on factorial combinations of major factors that determine phytoplankton composition and sensitivity to nutrients: alkalinity (low and medium-high), colour (clear and humic) and mixing intensity (polymictic and stratified). In line with expectations, cyanobacteria increased with temperature and retention time in five of the eight lake types. Temperature effects were greatest in lake types situated at higher latitudes, suggesting that lakes currently not at risk could be affected by warming in the future. However, the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to temperature, retention time and phosphorus varied among lake types highlighting the complex responses of lakes to multiple stressors. For example, in polymictic, medium-high alkalinity, humic lakes cyanobacteria biovolume was positively explained by retention time and a synergy between TP and temperature, while in polymictic, medium-high alkalinity, clear lakes only retention time was identified as an explanatory variable. These results show that, although climate change will need to be accounted for when managing the risk of cyanobacteria in lakes, a ``one-size fits-all'' approach is not appropriate. When forecasting the response of cyanobacteria to future environmental change, including changes caused by climate and local management, it will be important to take this differential sensitivity of lakes into account.},

There is also a broad consensus that blooms are increasing with global warming, but the impacts of other concomitant environmental changes, such as an increase in extreme rainfall events, may affect this response. One of the potential effects of high rainfall events on phytoplankton communities is greater loss of biomass through hydraulic flushing. Here we used a shallow lake mesocosm experiment to test the combined effects of: warming (ambient vs. +4\textdegree C increase), high rainfall (flushing) events (no events vs. seasonal events) and nutrient loading (eutrophic vs. hypertrophic) on total phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Our hypotheses were that: (a) total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance would be higher in heated mesocosms; (b) the stimulatory effects of warming on cyanobacterial abundance would be enhanced in higher nutrient mesocosms, resulting in a synergistic interaction; (c) the recovery of biomass from flushing induced losses would be quicker in heated and nutrient-enriched treatments, and during the growing season. The results supported the first and, in part, the third hypotheses: total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance increased in heated mesocosms with an increase in common bloom-forming taxa\textemdash Microcystis spp. and Dolichospermum spp. Recovery from flushing was slowest in the winter, but unaffected by warming or higher nutrient loading. Contrary to the second hypothesis, an antagonistic interaction between warming and nutrient enrichment was detected for both cyanobacteria and chlorophyll-a demonstrating that ecological surprises can occur, dependent on the environmental context. While this study highlights the clear need to mitigate against global warming, oversimplification of global change effects on cyanobacteria should be avoided; stressor gradients and seasonal effects should be considered as important factors shaping the response.},

Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of variable salinity regimes (a natural stressor) and copper exposures (a pollutant stressor) on lysosomal destabilization. Field studies were also conducted with native oysters and hatchery-reared juvenile oysters deployed in situ at reference and polluted sites. Lysosomal integrity was not affected by either short-term or longer-term variations in salinity during laboratory experiments, and the destabilization indices were similar to those of deployed and native oysters from reference sites characterized by a range of salinities. However, laboratory Cu exposures (ranging from 2.5 to 20 mu g Cu l(-1)) caused significant adverse effects on lysosomal destabilization after only 18 h, and the effects were sustained or worsened with increasing exposure time and concentration. Hatchery-reared oysters deployed at or native oysters collected from polluted sites had significantly higher lysosomal destabilization indices. Estuarine habitats are characterized by variable salinity regimes, so cellular responses that are sensitive to salinity stress as well as contaminant stress would be difficult to interpret if salinity effects cannot be distinguished from pollutant effects. A robust biomarker of anthropogenic effects should be insensitive to natural stressors such as salinity, but should be sensitive to pollutants. The salinity and contaminant studies described in this paper indicate that lysosomal destabilization responses in oysters are insensitive to salinity variations and sensitive to pollutants, and are therefore potentially valuable biomarkers of anthropogenic stress.},

The effects on lysosomal destabilization and glutathione concentrations were determined; and the relationships between the cellular responses and sediment metal concentrations were described. Both single metal and multiple metal parameters (based on total metal concentrations, aluminum normalizations, and summed sediment quality guidelines) were considered. Generally, significant correlations were observed for individual metal analytes and multiple metal parameters. Since many of the individual metal analytes covary, the responses may reflect overall contaminant loading rather than responses to individual metals. Methods for estimating overall contaminant loading based on multiple analytes provide a more realistic estimate of potential adverse effects. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Prochlorococcus PCC 9511 differs from the latter in possessing horseshoe-shaped thylakoids, exhibiting a low chlorophyll b2 content and lacking phycoerythrin, but shares these phenotypic properties with Prochlorococcus strain CCMP 1378. This relationship was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequence analyses, which clearly demonstrated that the axenic isolate is not co-identic with the nomenclatural type. Strain PCC 9511 has a low mean DNA base composition (32 mol\% G+C) and harbours the smallest genome of all known oxyphotobacteria (genome complexity 1.3 GDa = 2 Mbp). Urea and ammonia are the preferred sources of nitrogen for growth, whereas nitrate is not utilized. Several different organic phosphorus compounds efficiently replace phosphate in the culture medium, indicative of ecto-phosphohydrolase activity.

By transforming DOM into particulate detritus, sponges play a key role in transferring the energy and nutrients in DOM to higher trophic levels on Caribbean reefs via the so-called sponge loop. Coral mucus may be a major DOM source for the sponge loop, but mucus uptake by sponges has not been demonstrated. Here we used laboratory stable isotope tracer experiments to show the transfer of coral mucus into the bulk tissue and phospholipid fatty acids of the warm-water sponge Mycale fistulifera and cold-water sponge Hymedesmia coriacea, demonstrating a direct trophic link between corals and reef sponges. Furthermore, 21-40\% of the mucus carbon and 32-39\% of the nitrogen assimilated by the sponges was subsequently released as detritus, confirming a sponge loop on Red Sea warm-water and north Atlantic cold-water coral reefs. The presence of a sponge loop in two vastly different reef environments suggests it is a ubiquitous feature of reef ecosystems contributing to the high biogeochemical cycling that may enable coral reefs to thrive in nutrient-limited (warm-water) and energy-limited (cold-water) environments.},

Here, we report the effects of water browning on the responses, tolerance acquisition, and associated trade-offs in a population of microalgae exposed to sublethal concentrations of organic micropollutants over multiple generations. Our results show that dissolved organic matter (DOM) reduces toxic responses and modulates tolerance acquisition by the algae, possibly by complexing micropollutants. Microalgae that acquire tolerance allocate resources to fitness at the cost of reduced cell size. They yield higher productivity than nonadapted ones when grown in the presence of micropollutants but lower in their absence. The net trade-off was positive, indicating that adaptation can result in a higher productivity and fitness in tolerant species in recurrently stressed environments.},

This was necessary to give a conceptual framework for the discussion of longevity in the dairy herd as a heritable character, of its genetic relationship with milk yield and of the effects of selection on the genetical analysis of yield itself. 2. Culling is assumed to take place at the end of each lactation by truncation selection of a normally distributed variate (the culling variate) of which yield itself is a component. 3. Expressions are then derived for the effect of the culling on various parameters of yield and for survival as a function of yield. 4. The derivation of expressions relevant to progeny groups is dependent on the relative values of the genetic and phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on yield. 5. Because little is known of the actual causes of culling, it is not permissible to predict the genetic gain in yield by multiplying the selection differential by the heritability. This is only justified if the genetic and phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on yield are equal. 6. A direct estimate of the genetic gain by selection can, however, be obtained from the covariance for any character between the mean relative survival of progeny groups and their mean value for the character. 7. The effect of culling on the genetic analysis of yield in later lactations is discussed, as is the effect of later culling on survival to later ages as a function of early yield. It is suggested that the regression coefficient of relative survival of progeny groups on heifer yield will be approximately linear with age whereas that of individuals will probably increase to a limiting value. 8. The heritability of survival to different ages will probably pass through a maximum at the fourth lactation. 9. Longevity itself, as a function of heifer yield, is the sum of the cumulative survival curves to each individual lactation. The regression of length of life on heifer yield, at the individual or at the progeny test level, can be related to the mean phenotypic and genetic selection applied to animals in the herd at any time. 10. Because culling is to a large extent a voluntary action of the farmer, longevity in the dairy herd, though it is under continual selection and may have a significant heritability, need not necessarily increase.},

  abstract = {Temperature strongly influences microbial community structure and function, in turn contributing to global carbon cycling that can fuel further warming. Recent studies suggest that biotic interactions among microbes may play an important role in determining the temperature responses of these communities. However, how predation regulates these microbiomes under future climates is still poorly understood. Here, we assess whether predation by a key global bacterial consumer\textemdash protists\textemdash influences the temperature response of the community structure and function of a freshwater microbiome. To do so, we exposed microbial communities to two cosmopolitan protist species\textemdash Tetrahymena thermophila and Colpidium sp.\textemdash at two different temperatures, in a month-long microcosm experiment. While microbial biomass and respiration increased with temperature due to community shifts, these responses changed over time and in the presence of protists. Protists influenced microbial biomass and respiration rate through direct and indirect effects on bacterial community structure, and predator presence actually reduced microbial respiration at elevated temperature. Indicator species analyses showed that these predator effects were mostly determined by phylum-specific bacterial responses to protist density and cell size. Our study supports previous findings that temperature is an important driver of microbial communities but also demonstrates that the presence of a large predator can mediate these responses to warming.},

  abstract = {The climatic cycles of the Quaternary, during which global mean annual temperatures have regularly changed by 5-10\textdegree C, provide a special opportunity for studying the rate, magnitude, and effects of geographic responses to changing climates. During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past. Our results reveal the potential for paleophylogeographic models to (i) reconstruct past geographic range modifications, (ii) identify geographic processes that result in genetic bottlenecks; and (iii) predict threats due to anthropogenic climate change in the future. \textcopyright{} 2013 R\"odder et al.}

Mussels occupied integral of 0\% of soft substrates at 37-m sites and between 63 and 90\% at 55-m sites. Shell length and dry mass frequency distributions were similar at both sites, although recruits less than or equal to 5 mm comprised a larger proportion of the population at the deeper site. The population surveyed here allocated disproportionately less mass to shell and more to soft tissues relative to zebra mussels(Dreissena polymorpha) from shallow-water sites in eastern Lake Erie and from Lake St. Clair. The population at 55 m was slightly skewed toward male mussels(58\%). Female mussels that were examined for reproductive state contained mature oocytes(80\%) or had spent gonads(20\%). Because water temperature at the site was only 4.8 degree C, this survey provides the first evidence of gonadal development and spawning by quagga mussels at low temperature. These findings contrast with most reports of spawning by congeneric zebra mussels at temperatures greater than or equal to 12 degree C but are consistent with distributions of the species in different basins of the lake}

This chapter focuses upon the last category of variation. Variation is the norm for virtually all traits, particularly life-history traits. In part the variation is a consequence of genetic mechanisms\textemdash mutation\textendash selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, heterozygous advantage\textemdash and in part a result of external factors that lead to, for example, frequency-dependent selection, bet-hedging, and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The challenge is to determine the role each of these phenomena plays in generating and maintaining variation. It most likely varies both among traits and among species. Variation can occur in each type of environment, but each has unique features. There are two sources of variation, genetic and phenotypic. Genetic variation, in most cases, will be manifested also as phenotypic variation, whereas phenotypic variation may be the result of a single genotype showing genotype by environment interaction. The role of bet-hedging is still uncertain, as is the importance of antagonistic pleiotropy (the latter is certainly important in determining the optimum combination of traits but not necessarily in preserving variation). Frequency-dependent selection is important for discrete traits, but its impact on quantitative traits remains to be demonstrated, except in the cases in which the quantitative variation is coupled to discrete variation.},

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are tools for conservation and fisheries management, though there is still controversy regarding the best design for increasing their ecological effectiveness. Here, on the basis of a weighted meta-analytical approach, we have assessed the effect of 32 MPAs, distributed worldwide, on the biomass and density of piscivorous fishes. We analysed the MPA features and the biological, commercial and ecological characteristics of fishes that may affect the response of species to protection. We found a positive effect on the biomass and density of piscivores inside MPAs. This effect was stronger for the biomass of medium-sized fishes (in relation to the maximum size reported for the species) and the density of large and gregarious species. The size of the no-take zone had a significant negative impact on both response variables and differed according to the level of enforcement, with smaller no-take zones having higher levels of enforcement. Thus, MPAs help to protect piscivorous fish species, with smaller, but well enforced reserves being more effective for the protection of the local populations of piscivorous fishes throughout the world.},

  abstract = {Traits are widely used to detect and explain responses of ecosystem processes to environmental changes. Various studies use trait data from databases, often providing one value per trait and species, neglecting intraspecific trait variability along spatio-temporal gradients. Handbooks for standardized trait measurements claim that traits should be measured at an `optimal' stage, which is typically defined to be reached when the plants are in full blossom. However, it is unclear whether this method is appropriate. The main aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which trait values vary with season and phenology, a type of variation that has been overlooked so far relative to other sources of intraspecific variation. Further, we aimed to investigate whether species rankings remain consistent throughout the year. From April to November 2012, we monitored seven leaf traits [specific leaf area SLA, leaf dry matter content, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, performance-index PI], stomatal density, stomatal size and the stomatal pore area index SPI) of 15 summer green woody species weekly under controlled conditions. In parallel, we recorded phenological stages. The results showed that all traits varied significantly throughout the year in a species-specific manner. We detected trait relationships with vegetative but not with flowering phenology. Species rankings were inconsistent throughout the season in all traits. We concluded that the seasonal timing of trait measurements is crucial. Most notably SLA, Fv/Fm and stomatal size were the most robust traits in terms of small intraspecific and large interspecific variation and showed largely consistent species rankings across seasons. \textcopyright{} 2016 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic},

  abstract = {Across environmental gradients, community-level functional traits of plants can change due to species turnover, intraspecific variation and their covariation. Studies on vascular plants suggest that species turnover is the main driver of trait variation across gradients, although intraspecific variation can also be important. However, there is limited knowledge about whether this holds for non-vascular primary producers such as lichens and bryophytes. We hypothesized that intraspecific variation is more important for non-vascular than for vascular primary producers because they lack specialized structures to maintain homeostasis and should therefore be more responsive to extrinsic factors. To assess the relative importance of species turnover versus intraspecific variation for vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes, we estimated species abundance and measured chemical (tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) content, N:P ratio and pH) and non-chemical (specific leaf or thallus area, dry matter content and water holding capacity) functional traits along an elevational gradient in alpine southern Norway. We calculated community-weighted mean traits and quantified the relative contribution of species turnover, intraspecific variation and their covariation to total trait variation across the gradient. We found mixed support for our hypothesis: the contribution of intraspecific variation to total trait variation for N and N:P was higher in lichens than in vascular plants and bryophytes, but in general the contribution of intraspecific variation differed among functional traits and producer groups. Nutrient variables (N, P and N:P) were significantly impacted by intraspecific variation for vascular plants and lichens but not for bryophytes. Non-chemical traits and pH were mainly driven by species turnover effects in all primary producer groups. Our results highlight that while nearly all studies on primary producer trait variation across environments have focused on vascular plants, trait variation of other largely neglected but ecologically important producer groups, such as lichens and bryophytes, may show very different responses to the same environmental factors. In order to fully understand how future environmental changes impact on community- and ecosystem-level processes, traits of primary producers other than vascular plants\textemdash and their within-species variation\textemdash need to be considered in systems where these groups are abundant.

Theory and empirical synthesis suggest species adapted to more thermally variable climates are more capable of acclimating to rising temperatures, and are therefore characterized by greater phenotypic plasticity, than species adapted to less thermally variable environments. But this pattern has not been extensively evaluated for populations within a species that may inhabit different parts of a thermal gradient. In addition, it remains unclear whether different populations with different thermal sensitivities will maintain the same functional ecological roles as thermal regimes shift. To address this question, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment using Melanoplus femurrubrum grasshopper populations from Connecticut and Vermont, USA. During summer, the Vermont site was 3 \textdegree C cooler on average with 1.5-fold greater temperature variation than the Connecticut site. We measured thermal sensitivity (metabolic rate Q10) of individuals from each population reared in home field and transplanted sites and the nature and strength of trophic interactions with grasses and goldenrod (Solidago). Both grasshopper populations exhibited plasticity, but Q10 of both populations at Vermont was 1.5-fold broader than populations at the Connecticut site. All grasshoppers had similar survivorship but not similar effects on plants, exhibiting stronger effects on grasses in their home fields relative to their transplanted sites. Only Vermont grasshoppers transplanted to Connecticut significantly impacted Solidago. The study shows populations may physiologically acclimate quickly under new thermal conditions, suggesting stronger tolerance to change than often presumed. But, thermal acclimatization may not translate into the maintenance of a species' functional role. The work underscores the need to link analyses of physiological performance with ecological function to obtain a complete picture of climate change effects on communities.},

An example of a three-species interaction is also presented. Variations of the graph are introduced, and it is shown that an otherwise unstable interaction may be stabilized by the presence of either an inviolable prey hiding place, or extremely low predation pressure at moderate predator and high prey densities, or another predator-limiting resource. Stability is always conferred when the predator is severely limited at its equilibrium density by one of its resources other than its supply of prey. Predators should tend to be limited at their equilibrium densities by more than one of their resources. When either of the two foregoing situations pertains, regular predator-prey oscillations should not be observable. The stability of the interaction close to equilibrium was found to depend exclusively, in the mathematically-continuous model, upon the slopes of two lines in the graph at equilibrium. Stability can be asymptotic rather than oscillatory in type. An equation for the period of oscillatory interactions is also advanced. The effects of Natural Selection on the isoclines, and thus the stability, is not clear-cut. Selection of the prey tends to stabilize the interaction; the opposite is true for selection on the predator.},

Samples were analyzed for toxicity by ELISA and by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific oligonucleotide primers for the mcyB gene that has previously been correlated with the biosynthesis of toxic microcystins. Despite the fact that secreted toxin levels were relatively low in dense natural assemblages (3.5 {$\mu$}g l-1), detectable toxin levels increased by 90\% when M. aeruginosa was stressed by an increase in salinity, physical injury, application of the chemical herbicide paraquat, or UV irradiation. The application of the same stressors caused a three-fold increase in the production of H2O2 when compared to non-stressed cells. The application of micromolar concentrations of H2O2 induced programmed cell death (PCD) as measured by a caspase protease assay. Catalase was capable of inhibiting PCD, implicating H2O2 as the inducing oxidative species. Our results indicate that physical stressors induce oxidative stress, which results in PCD and a concomitant release of toxin into the surrounding media. Remediation strategies that induce cellular stress should be approached with caution since these protocols are capable of releasing elevated levels of microcystins into the environment. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This variation, termed                     response diversity                     , is therefore a potentially critical determinant of ecological stability. However, response diversity has yet to be widely quantified, possibly due to difficulties in its measurement. Even when it has been measured, approaches have varied.                                                                        Here, we review methods for measuring response diversity and from them distil a methodological framework for quantifying response diversity from experimental and/or observational data, which can be practically applied in laboratory and field settings across a range of taxa.                                                     Previous empirical studies on response diversity most commonly invoke response traits as proxies aimed at capturing species' ecological responses to the environment. Our approach, which is based on environment-dependent ecological responses to any biotic or abiotic environmental variable, is conceptually simple and robust to any form of environmental response, including nonlinear responses. Given its derivation from empirical data on species' ecological responses, this approach should more directly reflect response diversity than the trait-based approach dominant in the literature.                                                     By capturing even subtle inter- or intraspecific variation in environmental responses, and environment dependencies in response diversity, we hope this framework will motivate tests of the diversity\textendash stability relationship from a new perspective, and provide an approach for mapping, monitoring and conserving this critical dimension of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Traits of organisms vary both at inter- and intraspecific levels. For macro-detritivores inhabiting lands and waters, there is only scattered information on the relative contribution of the intraspecific level for traits like litter consumption rates. This basic knowledge is nevertheless required to know how much the intraspecific level could matter to the study of macro-detritivore communities and ecosystem processes like leaf litter decomposition. We performed a laboratory experiment, where thirty individuals each of five abundant macro-detritivore species from a stream and a meadow ecosystem fed ash (Fraxinus excelsior) leaf litter in microcosms, twice at a 1-week interval. This nested and repeated design (individuals nested within species, species within ecosystems) was setup in controlled conditions and then analysed following a variance partitioning approach with linear mixed-effect models, to assess the variance attributable to different levels of biological organisation (i.e., inter- and intraspecific level). Then, we performed the same analysis, but separately on aquatic and terrestrial datasets. From the whole dataset, we demonstrated that half of the trait variation occurred at the interspecific level and a third at the intraspecific level. The variance found at the residual level, accounting for both measurement errors and for the variation of the same individuals between the two times (i.e., intra-individual variation), was significantly lower than what was observed at the other levels of biological organisation. Variance partitioning on separate aquatic and terrestrial datasets were consistent altogether, confirming the global pattern. With this study, we stress the relevance of the intraspecific level for future trait-based approaches applied to macro-detritivores.},

  abstract = {A model is developed to predict evolution in a population which contains a variety of ecologically specialized phenotypes. Individuals of each phenotype are assumed to specialize on a specific region of a resource axis present in the environment. The model, incorporating density-dependent effects on the fitness of the various phenotypes, predicts the number of individuals of each phenotype through time for both asexually and sexually reproducing populations. The lizard species, Anolis roquet, illustrates the kind of population treated by the model. The resource axis is prey size; small lizards preferentially utilize small prey, while large lizards exploit large prey. Field data on this species are used to estimate some of the parameters of the model. The model shows that there is an optimum number of individuals of each phenotype for a given set of resources and a given regime of interphenotypic competition. If the population has this optimum distribution of individuals, then the fitnesses of all phenotypes are equal and the largest population size is achieved. Any other distribution yields too many individuals of certain kinds and too few of others, and a smaller total population size. The model is solved analytically to characterize this optimum distribution thoroughly. The model also shows that an asexually reproducing population, provided it has enough genetic variability, attains the optimum distribution very rapidly, while a sexually reproducing population attains the optimum distribution only slowly if at all. As a result, the sexual population often suffers from overcrowding in some phenotypic classes and undercrowding in others, and has a lower population size. The reason a sexual population may not attain the optimum distribution is that there is always a direct relationship between the shape of the distribution of phenotypes in the whole population and the shape of the distribution of phenotypes among the offspring of each mating within the population. In particular, the variance in the population's phenotype distribution is always approximately twice the variance in the offspring phenotype distribution. Therefore, if a sexual population is to attain the optimum population distribution, its offspring distribution must have a certain shape. Natural selection will mold the offspring distribution to this special shape, but presumably this molding takes a very long time. If this is true, a sexual population in a new or changed environment attains the optimum population phenotype distribution much more slowly than an asexual population. The niche width of a population is the length of the interval on the resource axis from which the population obtains most (say 95\%) of its resources. There are two components to niche width: the within-phenotype component, which is due to the variety of resources used by each phenotype, and the between-phenotype component, which is due to the population's having a variety of phenotypes. The model summarized above concerns the evolution in asexual and sexual populations of the between-phenotype component of niche width. Also, an expression is derived which partitions niche width into the within-phenotype and between-phenotype components such that the total niche width is simply the sum of measures for these two components. Ecological release is an expansion in niche width by a population which originated in a packed fauna and which has newly colonized an open environment. A population may undergo release in either the within-phenotype or between-phenotype components of niche width or both. Because asexual populations attain the optimum population distribution of phenotypes more rapidly than do sexual populations, asexual ones have a greater potency for release in the between-phenotype component. This claim seems an important explanation for the colonizing ability of asexual species. The process of faunal buildup on an island is a race between a widening of the offspring phenotype distribution of the first species there and dispersion to the island by members of some other ecolo ically differentiated species. If the widening of the offspring phenotype distribution, and hence the niche width, is slow enough, vacant regions exist on the resource axis which facilitate establishment of emigrants from elsewhere. In plants, an alternative to achieving ecological release by widening the offspring phenotype distribution is to develop self-compatibility.},

  abstract = {/ South African water law as well as the country's water resource management policies are currently under review. The Water Law Principles, which were established as part of this review process, indicate a commitment to sustainable development of water resources and the protection of an ecological "reserve." Such policy goals highlight the limitations of traditional and current water-quality management strategies, which rely on stressor monitoring and associated regulation of pollution. The concept of an assimilative capacity is central to the implementation of the current water-quality management approach. Weaknesses inherent in basing water management on the concept of assimilative capacity are discussed. Response monitoring is proposed as a way of addressing some of the weaknesses. Following a global trend, the new policy goals emphasize the need to protect rather than to use the ability of ecosystems to recover from disturbances. This necessitates the adoption of response measurements to quantify ecological condition and monitor ecological change. Response monitoring focuses on properties that are essential to the sustainability of the ecosystem. These monitoring tools can be used to establish natural ranges of ecological change within ecosystems, as well as to quantify conceptually acceptable and unacceptable ranges of change. Through a framework of biological criteria and biological impairment standards, the results of response monitoring can become an integral part of future water resource management strategies in South Africa.

  abstract = {Background Regular phytoplankton monitoring in Dutch coastal waters is performed as an indicator of the ecological state of these waters. The monitoring program is focused on temporal and spatial changes of species composition and abundance. Flow cytometry has been introduced to provide additional information, to improve ecosystem understanding, and to increase the efficiency of analysis and reportage. Methods Phytoplankton community abundance and composition were routinely determined by flow cytometry and microscopy at six locations in the North Sea over three annual cycles between 2000 and 2003. Supplementary measurements were also made for fluorescence (chlorophyll-a and other pigments) and, in combination with flow cytometric and microscopic data, were used to determine phytoplankton abundance and composition as a function of their size distribution. Real-time imaging of species was also used to identify species on the basis of their flow cytometric optical characteristics. Results Flow cytometric analysis took 15 min on average. Analysis including data processing, and Web site reportage took less than 1 h. Phytoplankton concentrations (cells/ml), biomass (fluorescence/ml), and concentration of phycoerythrin- or phycocyanin-containing cells (cells/ml) as a function of their algal size were produced every 2 weeks on average. The phytoplankton integrated annual concentration and biomass were used as ecological indicators for overall phytoplankton status. Real-time imaging of cells in flow enabled the identification of dominant species and was applied as an early warning system for Phaeocystis spp. Conclusions The reproducibility and count precision due to the large number of observations of the flow cytometric technique provided reliable data for monitoring long-term trends. Flow cytometrically based analyses extended the lower detection limit ({$<$}0.5 {$\mu$}m) of analysis beyond the capabilities of other techniques such as the relation between small and larger phytoplankton, the relation between cell counts and biomass as a function of cell size, but also the ability to monitor and report on blooms of harmful algae. A good correlation was found between concentrations (cells/ml) measured by flow cytometry and microscopy. In practice, flow cytometric analysis of a single marine sample took 15 min on average. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, not much is known about how body shape is related to taxonomic richness, especially in microbes. Here we analyse global datasets of unicellular marine phytoplankton, a major group of primary producers with an exceptional diversity of cell sizes and shapes and, additionally, heterotrophic protists. Using two measures of cell shape elongation, we quantify taxonomic diversity as a function of cell size and shape. We find that cells of intermediate volume have the greatest shape variation, from oblate to extremely elongated forms, while small and large cells are mostly compact (e.g., spherical or cubic). Taxonomic diversity is strongly related to cell elongation and cell volume, together explaining up to 92\% of total variance. Taxonomic diversity decays exponentially with cell elongation and displays a log-normal dependence on cell volume, peaking for intermediate-volume cells with compact shapes. These previously unreported broad patterns in phytoplankton diversity reveal selective pressures and ecophysiological constraints on the geometry of phytoplankton cells which may improve our understanding of marine ecology and the evolutionary rules of life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

A rapid adaptive response of animals to such change could be due to reversible phenotypic flexibility, including behavioral flexibility. Our model, the African striped mouse Rhabdomys, is a small rodent widely distributed in southern Africa. The desert-living species R. pumilio displays social flexibility, whereby individuals switch their social organization in response to prevailing conditions, potentially allowing for persistence in rapidly changing environments. Individuals of the species from the moist grasslands (R. dilectus) show some flexible traits, but opportunities to utilize this potential are apparently not realized. The climate in southern Africa is predicted to become drier, making both desert and grassland species vulnerable to environmental change. Based on realized or potential social flexibility in striped mice, we provide three (not mutually exclusive) scenarios that consider: (i) extinction of the desert species as its habitat changes; (ii) range expansion and utilization of pre-existing adaptations of the desert species to displace the current grassland species; and (iii) grassland species exploiting their potential flexibility (behavioral adaptation) and surviving in their current habitat. Behavioral flexibility is costly but could allow species to persist in rapidly changing environments. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors. licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

It is widely accepted that diatoms are extremely sensitive to changes in Fe availability, with numerous in situ experiments demonstrating rapid growth and increased export of elements (e.g. C, Si and Fe) from surface waters as a result of Fe addition. Less is known about the effects of Fe enrichment on the phenotypes of diatoms, such as associated changes in nutritional value-furthermore, data on taxon-specific responses are almost non-existent. Enhanced supply of nutrient-rich waters along the coast of the subantarctic Kerguelen Island provide a valuable opportunity to examine the responses of phytoplankton to natural Fe enrichment. Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron radiation Fourier Transform Infrared (SR-FTIR) microspectroscopy to analyse changes in the macromolecular composition of diatoms collected along the coast and plateau of Kerguelen Island, Southern Ocean. SR-FTIR microspectroscopy enabled the analysis of individual diatom cells from mixed communities of field-collected samples, thereby providing insight into in situ taxon-specific responses in relation to changes in Fe availability. Phenotypic responses were taxon-specific in terms of intraspecific variability and changes in proteins, amino acids, phosphorylated molecules, silicate/silicic acid and carbohydrates. In contrast to some previous studies, silicate/silicic acid levels increased under Fe enrichment, in conjunction with increases in carbohydrate stores. The highly abundant taxon Fragilariopsis kerguelensis displayed a higher level of phenotypic plasticity than Pseudo-nitzschia spp., while analysis of the data pooled across all measured taxa showed different patterns in macromolecular composition compared to those for individual taxon. This study demonstrates that taxon-specific responses to Fe enrichment may not always be accurately reflected by bulk community measurements, highlighting the need for further research into taxon-specific phenotypic responses of phytoplankton to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2014 Author(s).}

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Patterns of connectivity and self-recruitment are recognized as key factors shaping the dynamics of marine populations. Connectivity is also essential for maintaining and restoring natural ecological processes with genetic diversity contributing to the adaptation and persistence of any species in the face of global disturbances. Estimates of connectivity are crucial to inform the design of both marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks. Among several approaches, genetic structure is frequently used as a proxy for patterns of connectivity. Using 8 microsatellite loci, we investigated genetic structure of the two-banded sea bream Diplodus vulgaris, a coastal fish that is both commercially and ecologically important. Adults were sampled in 7 locations (stretches of coastline approximately 8 km long) and juveniles in 14 sites ({$\sim$}100 to 200 m of coastline) along 200 km of the Apulian Adriatic coast (SW Adriatic Sea), within and outside an MPA (Torre Guaceto MPA, Italy). Our study found similar ge netic diversity indices for both the MPA and the surrounding fished areas. An overall lack of genetic structure among samples suggests high gene flow (i.e. connectivity) across a scale of at least 200 km. However, some local genetic divergences found in two locations demonstrate some heterogeneity in processes renewing the population along the Apulian Adriatic coast. Furthermore, two sites appeared genetically divergent, reinforcing our observations within the genetic makeup of adults and confirming heterogeneity in early stage genetics that can come from either different supply populations or from chaotic genetic patchiness occurring under temporal variation in recruitment and in the reproductive success. While the specific role of the MPA is not entirely known in this case, these results confirm the presence of regional processes and the key role of connectivity in maintaining the local population supply.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems face multiple anthropogenic threats globally, and the effects of these environmental stressors range from individual-level organismal responses to altered system functioning. Understanding the combined effects of stressors on process rates mediated by individuals in ecosystems would greatly improve our ability to predict organismal multifunctionality (e.g. multiple consumer-mediated functions). We conducted a laboratory experiment to test direct and indirect, as well as immediate and delayed effects of a heat wave (pulsed stress) and micropollutants (MPs) (prolonged stress) on individual consumers (the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) and their multifunctionality (i.e. consumption of basal resources, growth, reproduction, nutrient excretion and organic-matter cycling). We found that stressful conditions increased the process rates of multiple functions mediated by individual consumers. Specifically, the artificial heat wave increased process rates in the majority of the quantified functions (either directly or indirectly), whereas exposure to MPs increased consumption of basal resources which led to increases in the release of nutrients and fine particulate organic matter. Moreover, snails exposed to a heat wave showed decreased reproduction and nutrient excretion after the heat-wave, indicating the potential for ecologically relevant delayed effects. Our study indicates that the immediate and delayed effects of stressors on individual organisms may directly and indirectly impact multiple ecosystem functions. In particular, delayed effects of environmental stress on individual consumers may cumulatively impede recovery due to decreased functioning following a perturbation. Reconciling these results with studies incorporating responses at higher levels of biological complexity will enhance our ability to forecast how individual responses upscale to ecosystem multifunctionality.},

So far, most studies testing the importance of inter- versus intraspecific changes for how communities and their functioning responds to climate change are either short-term laboratory experiments in highly controlled (artificial) environments, or long-term field surveys suffering from lack of experimental manipulation. Here, we quantified how community composition and functioning has changed in response to long-term warming, including the potential direct and indirect effects via immediate and delayed physiological, non-heritable plastic, ecological, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary responses. We used a site-for-time approach, sampling sites in an artificially heated basin and a nearby area to quantify how \textquestiondown 30 years of experimental warming in situ affects benthic grazer communities and traits of grazer taxa, as well as their contribution to a key ecosystem function: grazing on filamentous algae. The community composition shifted with warming, because a non-native species was highly common, and taxa with higher mobility, became more common in the heated areas compared to the control sites. Warming altered community functioning but the underlying mechanisms varied between traits: increased metabolism was caused by intraspecific trait change, while increased grazing rate was mainly driven by species turnover. Our results suggest that both population- and community-level processes mediate the responses of natural communities to long-term environmental change, and that the ongoing warming of coastal waters is likely to alter the functioning of key marine ecosystems.},

The Italian Aesculapian snake Zamenis lineatus is a narrow-range endemic of southern Italy and Sicily, once considered as part of the widespread species Z. longissimus. To date, we still lack comprehensive data on geographic range and intraspecific diversity of Z. lineatus. In this study, we analysed 106 Aesculapian snakes across the Italian Peninsula and Sicily in order to define the genetic diversity and distribution range of Z. lineatus, its possible range overlap with Z. longissimus and to assess whether hybridization occurs at the species' range boundaries. We combined genetic data from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers with phenotypic data suitable for taxonomic identification. The observed phylogeographic pattern of Z. lineatus suggests: (i) a reduced peninsular range size, about a half of what is currently considered; (ii) limited genetic diversity and weak population structure; (iii) the occurrence of pervasive introgressive hybridization with Z. longissimus in the eastern contact zone. Together, results from this study indicate a higher extinction risk for Z. lineatus than previously appreciated and provide directions for future studies on the hybridization at the contact zone(s) between Z. lineatus and Z. longissimus. \textcopyright{} 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

In the Mediterranean Sea, slow-growing and long-lived gorgonian species are threatened by human disturbances and global environmental changes and concern about their conservation is rising. Alkaloid metabolites have proven to be essential in protecting these species from environmental stressors. Traditional profiling methodologies to detect these metabolites require a large quantity of living tissue. Here, the chemodiversity of gorgonian alkaloids was investigated by applying a fast and effective protocol combining extraction and derivatization using small-scale tissue samples and GC/MS analysis. The method was effective in identifying and quantifying alkaloids and guanine-based compounds. Eight N-heterocyclic compounds were found in six Mediterranean gorgonians differing for types and quantity. The metabolomic profile was conservative in species of the Eunicella genus, with three species sharing the same pattern. Conversely, Paramuricea clavata displayed a noticeable spatial pattern of variation among colonies collected in different locations. The analytical approach presented here proved to be effective, allowing rare, endangered, and small-sized species to be screened rapidly for detection of new compounds in order to explore their biological and ecological functions. \textcopyright{} 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland},

  abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, substantially contribute to marine primary production and have been the subject of extensive ecological and genomic studies. Little is known about their close relatives from freshwater and non-marine environments. Phylogenomic analyses (using 136 proteins) provide strong support for the monophyly of a clade of non-marine picocyanobacteria consisting of Cyanobium, Synechococcus and marine Sub-cluster 5.2; this clade itself is sister to marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. The most basal lineage within the Syn/Pro clade, Sub-Cluster 5.3, includes marine and freshwater strains. Relaxed molecular clock (SSU, LSU) analyses show that while ancestors of the Syn/Pro clade date as far back as the end of the Pre-Cambrian, modern crown groups evolved during the Carboniferous and Triassic. Comparative genomic analyses reveal novel gene cluster arrangements involved in phycobilisome (PBS) metabolism in freshwater strains. Whilst PBS genes in marine Synechococcus are mostly found in one type of phycoerythrin (PE) rich gene cluster (Type III), strains from non-marine habitats, so far, appear to be more diverse both in terms of pigment content and gene arrangement, likely reflecting a wider range of habitats. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the PE genes (mpeBA) evolved via a duplication of the cpeBA genes in an ancestor of the marine and non-marine picocyanobacteria and of the symbiotic strains Synechococcus spongiarum. A `primitive' Type III-like ancestor containing cpeBA and mpeBA had thus evolved prior to the divergence of the Syn/Pro clade and S. spongiarum. During the diversification of Synechococcus lineages, losses of mpeBA genes may explain the emergence of pigment cluster Types I, II, IIB, and III in both marine and non-marine habitats, with few lateral gene transfer events in specific taxa.},

This is predicted to affect wild organisms, particularly because of the central role that light regimes play in determining the timing of biological activity. Although many empirical studies have reported such effects, these have focused on particular species or local communities and have thus been unable to provide a general evaluation of the overall frequency and strength of these impacts. Using a new database of published studies, we show that exposure to artificial light at night induces strong responses for physiological measures, daily activity patterns and life history traits. We found particularly strong responses with regards to hormone levels, the onset of daily activity in diurnal species and life history traits, such as the number of offspring, predation, cognition and seafinding (in turtles). So far, few studies have focused on the impact of artificial light at night on ecosystem functions. The breadth and often strength of biological impacts we reveal highlight the need for outdoor artificial night-time lighting to be limited to the places and forms\textemdash such as timing, intensity and spectrum\textemdash where it is genuinely required by the people using it to minimize ecological impacts.},

Together, these processes sense and respond to the majority of the photosynthetically relevant solar spectrum, suggesting that CA provides fitness advantages across a broad range of light color niches. The recent discoveries of several new CA types suggest that additional CA systems involving additional light colors and molecular mechanisms will be revealed in coming years.

Filling this knowledge gap is crucial for global species management and conservation planning and to understand the potential impact of environmental changes on multiple species. Location: Global. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Methods: We collected population density estimates for a range of terrestrial vertebrates, including 364 estimates for amphibians, 850 for reptiles, 5,667 for birds and 7,651 for mammals. We contrasted the importance of life history traits and environmental predictors using mixed models and tested different hypotheses to explain the variation in population density for the four groups. We assessed the predictive accuracy of models through cross-validation and mapped the partial response of vertebrate population density to environmental variables globally. Results: Amphibians were more abundant in wet areas with high productivity levels, whereas reptiles showed relatively higher densities in arid areas with low productivity and stable temperatures. The density of birds and mammals was typically high in temperate wet areas with intermediate levels of productivity. The models showed good predictive abilities, with pseudo-R2 ranging between 0.68 (birds) and 0.83 (reptiles). Main conclusions: Traits determine most of the variation in population density across species, whereas environmental conditions explain the intraspecific variation across populations. Species traits, resource availability and climatic stability have a different influence on the population density of the four groups. These models can be used to predict the average species population density over large areas and be used to explore macroecological patterns and inform conservation analyses. \textcopyright{} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

This study combined well-established phenotyping techniques and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to characterise the extent of intra-specific variation for an array of meaningful traits among 18 populations of Pinus nigra growing in a common-garden experiment in central Spain, subject to summer drought. Data for eight traits describing above-ground growth, intrinsic water-use efficiency, water uptake patterns and reserve accumulation were obtained for 210 adult individuals belonging to the subspecies laricio, calabrica, nigra and salzmanii. UAV imagery was used to derive seven vegetation indices describing canopy structure and photosynthetic pigments. A strong inter-population differentiation arising from adaptation to cold and continental conditions at the geographical origin of the populations was found for growth traits, reserve accumulation, chlorophyll concentration and leaf surface area. Fast-growing populations, originating from milder climates, emerged in contrast to slow-growing populations, originating from colder and more continental areas of the species range. The latter were characterised by higher leaf chlorophyll concentration and higher investment in reserves. Inter-population variation was highly structured at the subspecies level. Subspecies laricio and calabrica were characterised by a higher growth investment, but diverged in relative radial to primary growth allometry, whereas subspecies nigra and salzmanii showed the highest investment in reserves. Importantly, variation of traits related to water economy was negligible, both at the population and subspecies level, indicating that Mediterranean populations of P. nigra may lack specific adaptation to drought stress. These results provided valuable information in forecasting the performance of this species in the context of climate change. Specifically, they anticipated the potential vulnerability of Mediterranean populations of P. nigra to future reduction in water availability.},

  abstract = {Oil spills are an importance source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the aquatic environment. Intertidal communities are particularly sensitive since most organisms from these ecosystems are sessile or present reduced mobility. Hence, it is important to validate the use of resident species as sentinels to characterize the impact of oil spills on the rocky shores and the improvement during the restoration process. Recently the advantages of using the shanny Lipophrys pholis in pollution monitoring within the northwestern Atlantic coast has been pointed out. Therefore, with the aim of further validating the use of L. pholis in pollution monitoring associated with petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination, a multi-biomarker approach study was carried out 1 week after a moderate oil spill from the waste treatment plant (WTP) of the major Portuguese refinery in the north of Portugal (Petrogal). Fish collected at 2km from the accident displayed a significant induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD) and fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) in bile (up to a 5-fold induction) in comparison with the pre-spill scenario, and a 15\% induction in erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), a biomarker of genotoxicity. In contrast, no significant differences were recorded in the reference site. In order to better characterize the time-course accumulation of FACs in bile after a PAH insult, laboratory exposure of L. pholis to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was performed. A clear dose-response accumulation of B[a]P metabolites was observed that closely reflected nominal exposure concentrations already after 3. d. Overall, the findings of the present study highlight the potential of L. pholis in pollution monitoring dealing not only with chronic contamination, but also with oil spill accidents of a moderate scale. Taking into consideration that EROD and FACs determinations in L. pholis are cost effective, rapid and easy to use, they offer a great potential to be incorporated into risk assessment of PAHs in the scope of national monitoring programs and the European Water Policy legislation. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A total of 77 lakes were sampled by citizen volunteers for microcystin, total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a. Microcystin was measured in depth-integrated samples collected from the euphotic zone as well as in surface-water samples collected along the shoreline. Average microcystin in samples collected by volunteers was not different from samples collected side-by-side by professionals. Euphotic-zone microcystin was positively related to TP in lakes without dreissenids (uninvaded) but not in lakes with dreissenids (invaded). Regression-tree analysis indicated that euphotic-zone microcystin was eight times higher in the presence of dreissenids for lakes with TP between 5 and 10 ??g L-1. In contrast, euphotic-zone microcystin was almost identical in invaded and uninvaded lakes with TP between 10 and 26 ??g L-1. Across all lakes, microcystin concentrations at the surface were on average more than double, and in some cases an order-of-magnitude greater than, concentrations in the euphotic-zone. Given these results, it seems prudent to include dreissenid invasion status in forecasting models for microcystin, and to include shoreline sampling in monitoring programs aimed at assessing recreational exposure to cyanobacterial toxins. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The toxic dinoflagellate species Gambierdiscus caribaeus was sampled during 2 years in the Florida Keys, and repeatedly from 2006 to 2016 at St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands (USVI), including a 3-year period with monthly sampling, enabling a comparison of spatial and temporal genetic differentiation. Samples from the USVI site showed high temporal variability in local population structure, which correlated with changes in salinity and benthic habitat cover. In some cases, temporal variability exceeded spatial differentiation, despite apparent lack of connectivity and dispersal across the Greater Caribbean Region based on the spatial genetic data. Thus, local processes such as selection might have a stronger influence on population structure in microorganisms than geographic distance. The observed high temporal genetic diversity challenges the prediction of harmful algal blooms and toxin concentrations, but illustrates also the evolutionary potential of microalgae to respond to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2018 Sassenhagen, Gao, Lozano-Duque, Parsons, Smith and Erdner.},

However, there has been little study so far on their impact on marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs). For this reason, four experiments were carried out between April 2006 and February 2007 in the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean coast). We investigated whether viruses could affect HF communities, and specifically two uncultured marine stramenopile groups (MAST-4 and MAST-1C). For each experiment, four microcosms containing 12 L of 5-\textmu m filtered seawater were prepared, two received active viruses and the other two received heat-inactivated viruses. Microcosms were then incubated for 48 h in order to measure changes in the abundance of the target groups. In three of the four experiments, both the growth rates of HF and MAST-4 cells and the percentage of MAST-4 cells with respect to HF after 48 h were higher in the heat-inactivated treatment compared with the active viruses treatment. These results indicate that viruses can negatively affect the HF community either directly via lysis of protists or indirectly via lysis of bacteria, and highlight the interactions between, virus, bacteria and protists.},

Thousands of profiles are available from historical databases and the integration of fluorescence sensors to autonomous platforms led to a significant increase of chlorophyll fluorescence profile acquisition. To our knowledge, this important source of environmental data has not yet been included in global analyses. A total of 268 127 chlorophyll fluorescence profiles from several databases as well as published and unpublished individual sources were compiled. Following a robust quality control procedure detailed in the present paper, about 49 000 chlorophyll fluorescence profiles were converted in phytoplankton biomass (i.e. chlorophyll a concentration) and size-based community composition (i.e. microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton), using a{$\sim$}method specifically developed to harmonize fluorescence profiles from diverse sources. The data span over five decades from 1958 to 2015, including observations from all major oceanic basins and all seasons, and depths ranging from surface to a median maximum sampling depth of around 700 m. Global maps of chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton community composition are presented here for the first time. Monthly climatologies were computed for three of Longhurst's ecological provinces in order to exemplify the potential use of the data product.

Only cells below a certain size threshold can be sexualized, but various environmental factors can modulate the success of sexual reproduction. We investigated the role of cell density and physiological conditions of parental strains in affecting the success and timing of sexual reproduction in the marine heterothallic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata. We also studied the dynamics of the sexual phase in still conditions allowing cell sedimentation and in gently mixed conditions that keep cells in suspension. Our results showed that successful sexual reproduction can only be achieved when crossing parental strains in the exponential growth phase. Evidence was provided for the fact that sexual reproduction is a density-dependent event and requires a threshold cell concentration to start, although this might vary considerably amongst strains. Moreover, the onset of the sexual phase was coupled to a marked reduction in growth of the vegetative parental cells. The crosses carried out in physically mixed conditions produced a significantly reduced number of sexual stages as compared to crosses in still conditions, showing that mixing impairs sexualization. The results of our experiments suggest that the signaling that triggers the sexual phase is favored when cells can accumulate, reducing the distance between them and facilitating contacts and/or the perception of chemical cues. Information on the progression of the sexual phase in laboratory conditions help understanding the conditions at which sex occurs in the natural environment.},

Phytoplankton growth and diversity may, besides other factors, be controlled by seasonal temperature changes and increasing water temperatures. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of temperature and diversity on phytoplankton growth. In a controlled laboratory experiment, monocultures of 15 freshwater phytoplankton taxa (green algae, cyanobacteria, and diatoms) as well as 25 mixed communities of different species richness (2-12 species) and taxa composition were exposed to constant temperatures of 12, 18, and 24 \textdegree C. Additionally, they were exposed to short-term daily temperature peaks of +4 \textdegree C. Increased species richness had a positive effect on phytoplankton growth rates and phosphorous content at all temperature levels, with maximum values occurring at 18 \textdegree C. Overyielding was observed at almost all temperature levels and could mostly be explained by complementary traits. Higher temperatures resulted in higher fractions of cyanobacteria in communities. This negative effect of temperature on phytoplankton diversity following a shift in community composition was most obvious in communities adapted to cooler temperatures, pointing to the assumption that relative temperature changes may be more important than absolute ones. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).},

Using our method, we can easily create stationary subdivision schemes for Gaussian functions, spiral curves, and circles with uniform parametrizations. More generally, we show that stationary subdivision schemes for ep (x), cos (p (x)) and sin (p (x)) for any polynomial or piecewise polynomial p (x) can be generated using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and square roots. The smoothness of our nonlinear subdivision schemes is inherited from the smoothness of the original linear subdivision schemes and the differentiability of the corresponding nonlinear averaging rules. While our results are quite general, our proofs are elementary, based mainly on the observation that generic nonlinear averaging rules on a pair of real or complex numbers can be constructed by conjugating linear averaging rules with locally invertible nonlinear maps. In a forthcoming paper we show that every continuous nonlinear averaging rule on a pair of real or complex numbers can be constructed by conjugating a linear averaging rule with an associated continuous locally invertible nonlinear map. Thus the averaging rules considered in this paper are actually the general case. As an application we show how to apply our nonlinear subdivision algorithms to intersect some common transcendental functions. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

However, the sparse proxy evidence of the palaeo-stability of the GIS means that its history is controversial (compare refs 2 and 3 to ref. 4). Here we show that Greenland was deglaciated for extended periods during the Pleistocene epoch (from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago), based on new measurements of cosmic-ray-produced beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in a bedrock core from beneath an ice core near the GIS summit. Models indicate that when this bedrock site is ice-free, any remaining ice is concentrated in the eastern Greenland highlands and the GIS is reduced to less than ten per cent of its current volume. Our results narrow the spectrum of possible GIS histories: the longest period of stability of the present ice sheet that is consistent with the measurements is 1.1 million years, assuming that this was preceded by more than 280,000 years of ice-free conditions. Other scenarios, in which Greenland was ice-free during any or all Pleistocene interglacials, may be more realistic. Our observations are incompatible with most existing model simulations that present a continuously existing Pleistocene GIS. Future simulations of the GIS should take into account that Greenland was nearly ice-free for extended periods under Pleistocene climate forcing.}

In growth-inhibition tests under static conditions the algae revealed a higher sensitivity to the toxicants than the ciliate except for lindane and methyl parathion. Comparison of the impairment of photosynthetic efficiency (EPR, NOEC 24 hr) with the inhibition of growth (NOEC 72 hr) of S. subspicatus revealed a higher sensitivity of the EPR parameter for inhibitors of the photosynthesis. A flowthrough system was developed for long-term tests and testing of volatile and instable substances. Under flowthrough conditions C. reinhardi was more susceptible to the chemicals than under static test conditions, except for pentachlorophenol. Due to the high volatility, 1,2- dichloropropane was only tested in the flowthrough system. The data obtained from these toxicity tests provide information about effects on organisms representing different levels of the aquatic food web, possessing differences in sensitivity against toxicants. The presented flowthrough system allows the testing of volatile and instable chemicals, problematic in static test systems, and the EPR parameter is suitable for the early characterization of chemicals acting as specific inhibitors of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. \textcopyright{} 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

However, in the River Rhine (Germany), the D. polymorpha population is declining, whereas the closely related quagga mussel D. bugensis is found in high numbers at some sites. In the present laboratory study, D. polymorpha and D. bugensis were exposed to resuspended native sediments for {$\leq$}2 weeks. Wet sediments (\textexclamdown 63 {$\mu$}m, 100 mg l(-1) dry weight) were used as surrogate suspended particulate matter to mimic one of the mussels' main uptake route for chemicals. The sediments were sampled in (1) the River Elbe in Dessau, a site known to be highly polluted with, e.g., organochlorine (OC) pesticides and (2) at a relatively unpolluted site in Havelberg in the River Havel, one of the Elbe's tributaries. Chemical analysis of persistent OC compounds (seven polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], DDT and its metabolites (DDX), hexachlorocylohexanes [HCHs], and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) in soft tissue of mussels showed significantly greater values of PCBs 101, 118, 153, 138, 180, the sum of seven PCBs, and p,p'-DDD in D. bugensis compared with D. polymorpha. Fourteen days of exposure to Dessau sediment increased the concentration of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD, as well as the sum of DDX, in both species compared with Havelberg sediment. Interspecific differences were less pronounced when regarding chemical concentrations with lipid content instead of dry-weight of tissue because D. bugensis had greater levels of total lipid than D. polymorpha. DNA damage in gills, as measured with the comet assay, was greater in D. bugensis compared with D. polymorpha. Simultaneously, the content of heat-shock protein (hsp70) in gills was greater in D. polymorpha than in D. bugensis. DNA damage and hsp70 were not induced by exposure time or sediment type. This study shows that D. bugensis and D. polymorpha may differ in their bioaccumulation potential of OC pesticides as well as their levels of DNA damage and hsp70. Therefore, more investigations are needed before quagga mussel can be used as alternative test organism for the zebra mussel.},

  abstract = {River ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, including habitat degradation, pollution and invasive species. However, freshwater ecologists have largely disregarded the contribution of toxicants to stress in rivers, whereas ecotoxicologists have primarily examined toxicant effects in artificial systems. As a result, there is a paucity of information on the co-occurrence of organic toxicants with other stressors and on the relative importance of toxicants for overall ecological risk in rivers. We used monitoring data for German rivers to analyse the individual and joint occurrence of four stressors: habitat degradation, invasive species, nutrient pollution and organic toxicants. All stressors were examined for ecological risks in terms of whether they exceeded low- and high-risk thresholds derived from published studies and regulatory thresholds. Nutrients and habitat degradation exceeded low and high risk thresholds at c. 85\% of the sites and invasive species and organic toxicants at c. 50\% of the sites. At least one stressor exceeded thresholds at all sites for which data on all four stressors were available. Toxicity showed weak positive correlations with nutrients and habitat degradation (0.2 {$<$} Spearman's {$\rho$} {$<$} 0.34, 0.009 {$<$} P {$<$} 0.08). The risks of ecological effects arising from habitat degradation and invasive species were higher in lowland rivers, particularly for invasive species. Our assessment shows that organic toxicants contribute notably to risks of ecological effects in rivers, to a similar extent as invasive species, although habitat degradation and nutrients are the dominant stressors. Exposure to multiple stressors is the typical situation prevailing in rivers. Consequently, mitigation measures focusing on individual stressors may not be effective at reducing ecological risks. This suggests that integrating concepts and data from freshwater ecology and ecotoxicology is essential to meet the challenge of managing multiple stressors in river ecosystems.},

Conservation and restoration require understanding the individual and joint action of these stressors to evaluate and prioritize management measures.

These studies have provided valuable insights about the complexity of multiple stressor effects, but remain largely devoid of a theoretical framework for null model selection and prediction of effects. We suggest that multiple stressor research would benefit by (1) integrating and developing additional null models and (2) selecting null models based on their mechanistic assumptions of the stressor mode of action and organism sensitivities as well as stressor\textendash effect relationships for individuals and populations. We present a range of null models and outline their underlying assumptions and application in multiple stressor research. Moving beyond mere description requires multiple stressor research to shift its focus from identifying statistically significant interactions to the use and development of mechanistic (null) models. Justified selection of the appropriate null model is a first step to achieve this.},

Our model tested the assumptions and predictions of the theory of genetic assimilation, explored the evolutionary dynamics of the Baldwin effect, and provided expectations for the evolutionary response to climate change. We found that genetic assimilation as originally postulated is not likely to occur because the replacement of plasticity by fixed genetic effects takes much longer than the environment is likely to remain stable. On the other hand, trait plasticity as an enhancement to continual evolutionary change may be an important evolutionary mechanism as long as plasticity has little or no costs. Whether or not plasticity helps or hinders evolutionary rescue following a step change in the environment depends on whether plasticity is costly. For linear environmental change, noncostly plasticity always decreases extinction rates, while costly plasticity can create a fitness drag and increase the chance of extinction. Thus, with changing climates plasticity can enhance adaptation and prevent extinction under some conditions, but not others.},

Based on an extensive dataset with 3105 fish sampling sites, patterns of stressors, their combination and nature of interactions, i.e. synergistic, antagonistic and additive were investigated. Geographical distribution and patterns of seven human stressor variables, belonging to four stressor groups (hydrological-, morphological-, water quality- and connectivity stressors), were examined, considering both single and multiple stressor combinations. To quantify the stressors' ecological impact, a set of 22 fish metrics for various fish assemblage types (headwaters, medium gradient rivers, lowland rivers and Mediterranean streams) was analysed by comparing their observed and expected response to different stressors, both acting individually and in combination. Overall, investigated fish sampling sites are affected by 15 different stressor combinations, including 4 stressors acting individually and 11 combinations of two or more stressors; up to 4 stressor groups per fish sampling site occur. Stressor-response analysis shows divergent results among different stressor categories, even though a general trend of decreasing ecological integrity with increasing stressor quantity can be observed. Fish metrics based on density of species `intolerant to water quality degradation' and `intolerant to oxygen depletion'' responded best to single and multiple stressors and their interactions. Interactions of stressors were additive (40\%), synergistic (30\%) or antagonistic (30\%), emphasizing the importance to consider interactions in multi-stressor analyses. While antagonistic effects are only observed in headwaters and medium-gradient rivers, synergistic effects increase from headwaters over medium gradient rivers and Mediterranean streams to large lowland rivers. The knowledge gained in this work provides a basis for advanced investigations in European river basins and helps prioritizing further restoration and management actions.},

  abstract = {Our current understanding of the temperature response of biological processes in soil is based on the Arrhenius equation. This predicts an exponential increase in rate as temperature rises, whereas in the laboratory and in the field, there is always a clearly identifiable temperature optimum for all microbial processes. In the laboratory, this has been explained by denaturation of enzymes at higher temperatures, and in the field, the availability of substrates and water is often cited as critical factors. Recently, we have shown that temperature optima for enzymes and microbial growth occur in the absence of denaturation and that this is a consequence of the unusual heat capacity changes associated with enzymes. We have called this macromolecular rate theory \textendash{} MMRT (Hobbs et al., , ACS Chem. Biol. 8:2388). Here, we apply MMRT to a wide range of literature data on the response of soil microbial processes to temperature with a focus on respiration but also including different soil enzyme activities, nitrogen and methane cycling. Our theory agrees closely with a wide range of experimental data and predicts temperature optima for these microbial processes. MMRT also predicted high relative temperature sensitivity (as assessed by Q10 calculations) at low temperatures and that Q10 declined as temperature increases in agreement with data synthesis from the literature. Declining Q10 and temperature optima in soils are coherently explained by MMRT which is based on thermodynamics and heat capacity changes for enzyme-catalysed rates. MMRT also provides a new perspective, and makes new predictions, regarding the absolute temperature sensitivity of ecosystems \textendash{} a fundamental component of models for climate change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyanobacteria are one of the oldest and morphologically most diverse prokaryotic phyla on our planet. The early development of an oxygen-containing atmosphere approximately 2.45-2.22 billion years ago is attributed to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria. Furthermore, they are one of the few prokaryotic phyla where multicellularity has evolved. Understanding when and how multicellularity evolved in these ancient organisms would provide fundamental information on the early history of life and further our knowledge of complex life forms. RESULTS: We conducted and compared phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA sequences from a large sample of taxa representing the morphological and genetic diversity of cyanobacteria. We reconstructed ancestral character states on 10,000 phylogenetic trees. The results suggest that the majority of extant cyanobacteria descend from multicellular ancestors. Reversals to unicellularity occurred at least 5 times. Multicellularity was established again at least once within a single-celled clade. Comparison to the fossil record supports an early origin of multicellularity, possibly as early as the "Great Oxygenation Event" that occurred 2.45-2.22 billion years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a multicellular morphotype evolved early in the cyanobacterial lineage and was regained at least once after a previous loss. Most of the morphological diversity exhibited in cyanobacteria today\textendash including the majority of single-celled species\textendash arose from ancient multicellular lineages. Multicellularity could have conferred a considerable advantage for exploring new niches and hence facilitated the diversification of new lineages.},

Although originally developed for oceanographic observations only, the underlying concept is more general, and data or model output from other areas of geosciences, like for instance geology, geophysics, geography and atmospheric research can be maintained and explored with ODV as well. The data format of ODV is designed for dense storage and direct data access, and allows the construction of very large datasets, even on affordable and portable hardware. ODV supports display of original data by colored dots or actual data values at the measurement locations. In addition, two fast and reliable variable-resolution gridding algorithms allow color shading and contouring of gridded fields along sections and on general 3D surfaces. A large number of derived quantities can be selected and calculated online. These variables are displayed and analyzed in the same way as the basic variables stored in disk files. ODV runs on PCs under Windows and on UNIX workstations under SUN Solaris. The software and extensive sets of coastline, topography, river-, lake- and border outlines as well as various gazetteers of topographic features are available at no cost over the Internet. In addition, the electronic atlas eWOCE that consists of oceanographic data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is also available free of charge over the Internet. A gallery of prepared plots of property distributions along WOCE sections provides a quick overview over hydrographic, nutrient, oxygen and transient tracer fields in the ocean and, apart from the scientific use for oceanographic research, can serve as tutorial material for introductory or advanced courses on oceanography. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we tested how this so-called transgressive overyielding is affected by variation between and within species in monoculture yields in biodiversity experiments. Methods We use basic statistical principles to calculate expected maximum monoculture yield in a species pool used for a biodiversity experiment. Using a real example we show how between- and within-species variance components in monoculture yields can be obtained. Combining the two components we estimate the importance of sampling bias in transgressive overyielding analysis. Important Findings The net biodiversity effect (difference between mixture and average monoculture yield) needed to achieve transgressive overyielding increases with the number of species in a mixture and with the variation between constituent species in monoculture yields. If their is no significant variation between species, transgressive overyielding should not be calculated using the best monoculture, because in this case the difference between this species and the other species could exclusively reflect a sampling bias. The sampling Has decreases with increasing variation between species. Tests for transgressive overyielding require replicated species' monocultures. However, it call be doubted whether such an emphasis on monocultures in biodiversity experiments is justified if an analysis of transgressive overyielding is not the major goal.},

The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

Physical laws provide possibilities and opportunities for an organism, yet they also impose constraints, setting limits to what is physically possible. This book aims to give an understanding of these rules because of their profound implications when we deal with animals of widely different size and scale. The reader will find that the book raises many questions. Remarkable and puzzling information makes it read a little like a detective story, but the last chapter, instead of giving the final solution, neither answers all questions nor provides one great unifying principle.},

In this study, we examined various biomarkers of stress (glutathione S-transferase (GST)), reproduction (vitellin-like proteins) and damage (lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage (DNA)) in marine mussels (Mytilus spp.) from a known pristine hybrid zone. Levels of all biomarker expression varied between seasons and appeared to be linked to the reproductive cycle. Oxidative stress in winter, with low GST expression and a higher expression of LPO and DNA damage displayed could be explained by low food availability.

  abstract = {This study derives simple models of competition and applies them to the description and prediction of habitat shift. Habitat shift is a change from one species population to another in the habitats occupied by most of their individuals. Interference models in which individuals are limited in their time for feeding by other individuals can give rise to competition equations structurally identical to Lotka-Volterra models. These models have linear zero-isoclines. Interference models in which individuals as a group are energy-limited produce nonlinear, concave downward, zero-isoclines. These are asymptotic to the axes. Unlike the linear-isocline case, such models always produce a unique stable equilibrium. Asymptotes may be made nonzero by inclusion of a refugium into the isocline equation. Exploitation models in which individuals of different species feed with finegrained selection on the same resources but gain different energies from these give parallel linear isoclines. They cannot produce a stable point equilibrium, whether consumption per individual is fixed or not. A simple model, in which individuals have flexible requirements and feed with fine-grained selection, has a unique stable equilibrium if each species has some resources not usable by the other. This model has concave downward isoclines. If one species utilizes only resource kinds included within those of another, both can coexist if the first is sufficiently better at obtaining the shared resources and if there are enough such resources. Systems of equations specifying growth of both consumers and resources can sometimes give isoclines that are linear (MacArthur, R. H. 1968, The theory of the niche in "Population Biology and Evolution," Syracuse Univ. Press) or that are of the same curvilinear form as isoclines for the pure consumer systems. One way to relate competition to habitat shift is to assume the isocline equations hold separately for each of a set of habitats. Then if estimates of carrying capacities are available, models for isoclines can be constructed and competition parameters computed by regression techniques, using data for each habitat as a separate point. Relative carrying capacity in Locality S (with competitors) can be estimated as follows. Measure the relative abundance of the species in its "fundamental" niche in Locality A (without competitors); then weigh it by the ratio of available resources in Locality S to available resources in Locality A. This method provides a possible structure for formalizing how competition transforms the "fundamental" into the "realized" niche. The method is applied to a shift in structural habitat (perch height and diameter) in some Caribbean lizards. Habitat availability is measured as relative surface area, estimated from vegetation using a new sampling technique. Results are: (1) nonlinear isoclines fit better than linear ones; (2) concave downward isoclines fit much better than convex downward isoclines; (3) an exploitative model fits better than all others, including interference and descriptive models; and (4) competitors of different sizes are more likely to fit interference than exploitative models; those of the same size show the opposite; and species best fitting interference models are more often the smaller member of pairs of differently sized competitors. \textcopyright{} 1974.},

Sponges are among the most diverse faunal groups in these ecosystems, and many of them host large abundances of microbes in their tissues. In this study, twelve sponge species from three cold-water coral reefs off Norway were investigated for the relationship between sponge phylogenetic classification (species and family level), as well as sponge type (high versus low microbial abundance), and the diversity of sponge-associated bacterial communities, taking also geographic location and water depth into account. Community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that as many as 345 (79\%) of the 437 different bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in the dataset were shared between sponges and sediments, while only 70 (16\%) appeared purely sponge-associated. Furthermore, changes in bacterial community structure were significantly related to sponge species (63\% of explained community variation), sponge family (52\%) or sponge type (30\%), whereas mesoscale geographic distances and water depth showed comparatively small effects (\textexclamdown 5\% each). In addition, a highly significant, positive relationship between bacterial community dissimilarity and sponge phylogenetic distance was observed within the ancient family of the Geodiidae. Overall, the high diversity of sponges in cold-water coral reefs, combined with the observed sponge-related variation in bacterial community structure, support the idea that sponges represent heterogeneous, yet structured microbial habitats that contribute significantly to enhancing bacterial diversity in deep-sea ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many species show intraspecific variation in their social organization (IVSO), which means the composition of their social groups can change between solitary living, pair living, or living in groups. Understanding IVSO is important because it demonstrates species resilience to environmental change and can help us to study ultimate and proximate reasons for group living by comparing solitary and group-living individuals in a single species. It has long been realized that the environment plays a key role in explaining the occurrence of IVSO. IVSO is expected to have evolved in variable environments and can thus be a key adaptation to environmental change. It has previously been suggested that four different mechanisms relying on the environment exist that can lead to IVSO: environmental disrupters, genetic differentiation, developmental plasticity, and social flexibility. All four mechanisms depend on the environment such that focusing only on environmental factors alone cannot explain IVSO. Importantly, only three represent evolved mechanisms, while environmental disrupters leading to the death of important group members induce nonadaptive IVSO. Environmental disrupters can be expected to cause IVSO even in species where IVSO is also an adaptive response. Here, we focus on the questions of why IVSO occurs and why it evolved. To understand IVSO at the species level, it is important to conduct continuous long-term studies to differentiate between nonadaptive and adaptive IVSO. We predict that IVSO evolves in environments that vary in important ecological variables, such as rainfall, food availability, and population density. IVSO might also depend on life history factors, especially longevity. IVSO is predicted to be more common in species with a short life span and that breed only for one breeding season, being selected to respond optimally to the prevailing environmental situation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of accounting for IVSO when studying social evolution, especially in comparative studies, as not every species can be assigned to one single form of social organization. For such comparative studies, it is important to use data based on the primary literature. \textcopyright{} 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics},

  abstract = {Background: The evolution of social cooperation is favored by aggregative behavior to facilitate stable social structure and proximity among kin. High dispersal rates reduce group stability and kin cohesion, so it is generally assumed that there is a fundamental trade-off between cooperation and dispersal. However, empirical tests of this relationship are rare. We tested this assumption experimentally using ten genetically isolated strains of a ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. Results: The propensity for social aggregation was greater in strains with reduced cell quality and lower growth performance. While we found a trade-off between costly aggregation and local dispersal in phenotypic analyses, aggregative strains showed a dispersal polymorphism by producing either highly sedentary or long-distance dispersive cells, in contrast to less aggregative strains whose cells were monomorphic local dispersers. Conclusion: High dispersal among aggregative strains may not destroy group stability in T. thermophila because the dispersal polymorphism allows social strains to more readily escape kin groups than less aggregative strains, yet still benefit from stable group membership among sedentary morphs. Such dispersal polymorphisms should be common in other social organisms, serving to alter the nature of the negative impact of dispersal on social evolution. \textcopyright{} 2009 Schtickzelle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Although the term environmental stress is used across multiple fields in biology, the inherent ambiguity associated with its definition has caused confusion when attempting to understand organismal responses to environmental change. Here I provide a brief summary of existing definitions of the term stress, and the related concepts of homeostasis and allostasis, and attempt to unify them to develop a general framework for understanding how organisms respond to environmental stressors. I suggest that viewing stressors as environmental changes that cause reductions in performance or fitness provides the broadest and most useful conception of the phenomenon of stress. I examine this framework in the context of animals that have evolved in highly variable environments, using the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, as a case study. Consistent with the extreme environmental variation that they experience in their salt marsh habitats, killifish have substantial capacity for both short-term resistance and long-term plasticity in the face of changing temperature, salinity and oxygenation. There is inter-population variation in the sensitivity of killifish to environmental stressors, and in their ability to acclimate, suggesting that local adaptation can shape the stress response even in organisms that are broadly tolerant and highly plastic. Whole-organism differences between populations in stressor sensitivity and phenotypic plasticity are reflected at the biochemical and molecular levels in killifish, emphasizing the integrative nature of the response to environmental stressors. Examination of this empirical example highlights the utility of using an evolutionary perspective on stressors, stress and stress responses. \textcopyright{} 2014.

One to several fistules, which protrude through the sand, are attached to the base of the sponge. On top of each fistule is a small fragile capitum. We examined whether this conspicuous red-colored sponge was chemically defended and if intraspecimen variation existed in the distribution of secondary metabolites between different parts of the sponge. Furthermore we assessed the deterrent properties of the secondary metabolites to generalist and more specialized fish predators. We also wanted to see if the optimal defense theory holds in the case of a marine invertebrate. According to the theory, organisms evolve and allocate defenses in a way that maximizes individual fitness, assuming that defenses are costly to the fitness of the organisms. We were able to evaluate this hypothesis: since the different sponge parts in Oceanapia sp. were at different risk to damage by predators and had a different value in terms of fitness loss to the sponge (the capitum probably plays a role in asexual propagation). Concentrations of crude organic extract increased from the base to the capitum of the sponge. The major secondary metabolites kuanoniamine C and D also: showed a sharp increase from the basal root to the capitum. There was no difference in structural material or ash content between the base and the fistule of the sponge, but fiber and protein content were significantly higher in the fistule. The methanol fraction was highly deterrent in field feeding assays towards generalist reef fish at base concentration. It also deterred feeding by the spongivorous angelfish Pomacanthus imperator laboratory feeding experiments at the same concentration. The field feeding assays with pure compounds-showed that kuanoniamine C and D deterred feeding by-natural assemblages of reef fishes at fistule concentrations, confirming their role as defensive agents. The intraspecimen variation of secondary metabolites in Ocennnpia spt supports the optimal defense theory by showing,the highest concentrations in those parts of the sponge that are most visible to predators and are likely to be most important for inclusive fitness.},

Populations at species' range margins may be especially crucial in containing a gene pool comprising adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Many species of northern European bog ecosystems reach their southern lowland range limit in central Europe. In a common-garden experiment, we experimentally assessed the impact of projected climatic changes on five bog-plant species (including peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient of 1400 km from Scandinavia to the marginal lowland populations in Germany. Populations were cultivated in monocultures and in experimental communities composed of all five species from their local community, and exposed to five combinations of three climate treatments (warming, fluctuating water-tables, fertilization) in a southern common garden. Whereas most monocultures showed a decreasing biomass production from southern to northern origins under southern environmental conditions, in the experimental mixed-species communities, an increasing biomass production towards northern communities was observed together with a shift in interspecific interactions along the latitudinal gradient. While negative dominance effects prevailed in southern communities, higher net biodiversity effects were observed in northern subarctic communities. The combined effects of climate treatments increased biomass production in monocultures of most origins. In communities, however, overall the treatments did not result in significantly changed biomass production. Among individual treatments, water-table fluctuations caused a significant decrease in biomass production, but only in southern communities, indicating higher vulnerability to changed climatic conditions. Here, negative effects of climate treatments on graminoids were not compensated by the slightly increased growth of peat moss that benefited from interspecific interactions only in northern communities. Synthesis. We conclude that shifting interactions within multispecies communities caused pronounced responses to changed climatic conditions in wetland communities of temperate southern marginal, but not of northern subarctic origin. Therefore, future models investigating the impacts of climate change on plant communities should consider geographical variation in species interactions an important factor influencing community responses to changed climatic conditions. \textcopyright{} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

  abstract = {Abstract: With recent increases in the numbers of species reintroduction projects and reintroduction-related publications, there is now a recognizable field of reintroduction biology. Nevertheless, research thus far has been fragmented and ad hoc, rather than an organized attempt to gain reliable knowledge to improve reintroduction success. We reviewed 454 recent (1990\textendash 2005) peer-reviewed papers dealing with wildlife reintroductions from 101 journals. Most research has been retrospective, either opportunistic evaluations of techniques or general project summaries, and most inference is gained from post hoc interpretation of monitoring results on a species-by-species basis. Documentation of reintroduction outcomes has improved, however, and the derivation of more general principles via meta-analyses is expected to increase. The fragmentation of the reintroduction literature remains an obstacle. There is scope to improve reintroduction biology by greater application of the hypothetico-deductive method, particularly through the use of modeling approaches and well-designed experiments. Examples of fruitful approaches in reintroduction research include experimental studies to improve outcomes from the release of captive-bred animals, use of simulation modeling to identify factors affecting the viability of reintroduced populations, and the application of spatially explicit models to plan for and evaluate reintroductions. We recommend that researchers contemplating future reintroductions carefully determine a priori the specific goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction and that evaluation processes incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches. We suggest that the best progress will be made when multidisciplinary teams of resource managers and scientists work in close collaboration and when results from comparative analyses, experiments, and modeling are combined within and among studies.},

Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

Global scale and Australia. We tested a variety of bioclimatic models for eight different plant species employing five discriminatory correlative species distribution models (SDMs) including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Bioclim, together with CLIMEX (CL) as a mechanistic niche model. These models were fitted using a training dataset of available global data, but with the exclusion of Australian locations. The capabilities of these techniques in projecting suitable climate, based on independent records for these species in Australia, were compared. Thus, Australia is not used to calibrate the models and therefore it is as an independent area regarding geographic locations. To assess and compare performance, we utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and fractional predicted areas for all SDMs. In addition, we assessed satisfactory agreements between the outputs of the six different bioclimatic models, for all eight species in Australia. The modeling method impacted on potential distribution predictions under current climate. However, the utilization of sensitivity and the fractional predicted areas showed that GLM, MaxEnt, Bioclim, and CL had the highest sensitivity for Australian climate conditions. Bioclim calculated the highest fractional predicted area of an independent area, while RF and BRT were poor. For many applications, it is difficult to decide which bioclimatic model to use. This research shows that variable results are obtained using different SDMs in an independent area. This research also shows that the SDMs produce different results for different species; for example, Bioclim may not be good for one species but works better for other species. Also, when projecting a "large" number of species into novel environments or in an independent area, the selection of the "best" model/technique is often less reliable than an ensemble modeling approach. In addition, it is vital to understand the accuracy of SDMs' predictions. Further, while TSS, together with fractional predicted areas, are appropriate tools for the measurement of accuracy between model results, particularly when undertaking projections on an independent area, AUC has been proved not to be. Our study highlights that each one of these models (CL, Bioclim, GLM, MaxEnt, BRT, and RF) provides slightly different results on projections and that it may be safer to use an ensemble of models.},

Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we next examine representative studies from the literature that investigated community responses to press (long-term) and pulse (short-term) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts about the unique insights that systems perspectives - informed by meta-omics data - may provide about microbial community stability.},

The model successfully simulated the observed long-term variability and warming trend of water temperatures in the region, indicating that the oceanographic climate is influenced primarily by local meteorology rather than by inflows of water from the NE Atlantic Ocean. The spring-neap tidal cycle is shown to affect the timing of the onset of stratification and the spring bloom, with established spring stratification usually beginning as tidal currents decrease from springs to neaps. Spring-neap tidal variability can also produce double spring blooms when stratification that develops after a neap tide is temporarily broken down by the increasing tidal mixing towards the next spring tide. Over the 30 years of model simulations the dominant meteorological control on the timing of the spring stratification and bloom was the spring air temperature. However, there is evidence that control by wind stress variability on the timing of spring stratification was more important before the early 1990s ( r2 = 0.32, significant at 95\%). After the early 1990s the wind stress was not significantly correlated with the timing of spring stratification, and the spring air temperature became the main control ( r2 = 0.33, significant at 95\%). Increasing air temperature also appears to have driven a gradual trend in the timing of stratification and the spring bloom since the mid 1990s of an average 1 day earlier per year ( r2 = 0.27, significant at 95\%). The link between the spring meteorology and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was investigated, indicating that the NAO played a role in the timing of stratification and the spring bloom prior to 1990, with a significant correlation between the NAO and the spring wind stress, but has had less of a role since 1990, with only a weak connection between the NAO and the spring air temperature. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined intraspecific variability in the effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide levels on net calcification (G n ) in the coral Acropora pulchra in Moorea, French Polynesia. A common garden experiment showed that G n in four colonies was affected negatively by high partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) ({$\sim$}1000 {$\mu$}atm cf. {$\sim$}400 {$\mu$}atm ambient conditions), whereas elevated temperature (30 \textdegree C cf. 27 \textdegree C) had a negative effect on one colony. Together, these results reveal intraspecific variation in the response of G n to temperature but not to pCO 2 . The fastest growing colonies under ambient temperature and ambient pCO 2 showed the greatest decline in G n at high temperature and elevated pCO 2 . For reef corals, effects of temperature and pCO 2 on calcification that depend on the intrinsic growth rate have potentially important consequences, because they imply that coral colonies contributing the most to population-level calcification will be disproportionately affected by changing environmental conditions. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

Similarly, phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of one genotype to generate multiple phenotypes, can act as both a facilitator and constraint on evolutionary processes. While there has been an increasing focus on correlated behavioural means (i.e. behavioural syndromes), less attention has been paid to how plasticity in different behavioural traits may be correlated. Such correlated behavioural plasticities are likely to affect evolution and ecology, although possibly in different ways. Here, we review key insights from three research fields, behavioural syndromes, phenotypic plasticity and integrated phenotypes to provide a conceptual framework to understand why, how and when plasticities of different behavioural traits may become correlated. In particular, the conditions under which plasticity and behavioural syndromes are predicted to be important are also where correlated behavioural plasticities are likely to have the strongest impacts. In this review, we define correlated behavioural plasticities, summarize the conditions that are likely to give rise to them and highlight testable predictions in an effort to spark targeted research into this important phenomenon. We also provide a worked example to highlight how studying correlated plasticity can yield important new insights.},

Although climate changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobiological studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause, biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas ({$\sim$}447-444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species. The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long- Term climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass extinction.},

Nano-scale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) showed {$\sim$}20\% transfer of organic matter derived from the infected (13)C- and (15)N-labelled P. globosa cells to Alteromonas sp. cells. Subsequent, viral lysis of P. globosa resulted in the formation of aggregates that were densely colonised by bacteria. Aggregate dissolution was observed after 2 days, which we attribute to bacteriophage-induced lysis of the attached bacteria. Isotope mass spectrometry analysis showed that 40\% of the particulate (13)C-organic carbon from the infected P. globosa culture was remineralized to dissolved inorganic carbon after 7 days. These findings reveal a novel role of viruses in the leakage or excretion of algal biomass upon infection, which provides an additional ecological niche for specific bacterial populations and potentially redirects carbon availability.},

FLB can be prepared both from natural bacterioplankton assemblages and from clonal isolates and can be stored in frozen suspension or freeze-dried without apparent loss of fluorescence intensity. They are not toxic to protozoa and can be metabolized to support bacterivorous protozoan growth rates equal to those on the same strain of unstained, viable bacteria. In experiments comparing uptake of FLB with uptake of fluorescent latex microspheres by protozoan assemblages in a salt marsh tidal creek, we found that both pelagic oligotrichous ciliates and phagotrophic flagellates ingested FLB with a frequency 4- to 10-fold greater than they ingested the microspheres. Consequently, it appears that the use of latex microspheres leads to underestimation of protozoan bacterivory and that the FLB technique is superior for estimating instantaneous rates of in situ protozoan grazing on bacterioplankton.},

Although similar oxidative response was shown by both biocides, diuron induced stronger retardation on reproduction and population growth rates of B. koreanus while moderate effects were observed by atrazine. This higher toxicity of diuron was shown to be associated with its stronger inhibition of MXR conferred by P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance proteins which play as a first line of defense by transporting various toxicants out of a cell. Our study provides new insight into non-targeted effects of biocides on marine zooplankton and mechanisms beyond their different degrees of toxicity.},

We discuss a different type of evolutionary mechanism that relies upon differential dispersal. Traits that enhance rates of dispersal inevitably accumulate at expanding range edges, and assortative mating between fast-dispersing individuals at the invasion front results in an evolutionary increase in dispersal rates in successive generations. This cumulative process (which we dub "spatial sorting") generates novel phenotypes that are adept at rapid dispersal, irrespective of how the underlying genes affect an organism's survival or its reproductive success. Although the concept is not original with us, its revolutionary implications for evolutionary theory have been overlooked. A range of biological phenomena (e.g., acceleration of invasion fronts, insular flightlessness, preadaptation) may have evolved via spatial sorting as well as (or rather than) by natural selection, and this evolutionary mechanism warrants further study.},

Synchronous dynamics can amplify the destabilizing effect of environmental variability on ecosystem functions such as productivity, whereas the inverse, compensatory dynamics, can stabilize function. Here we combine simulation and empirical analyses to elucidate mechanisms that underlie patterns of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics. In both simulated and empirical communities, we show that synchronous and compensatory dynamics are not mutually exclusive but instead can vary by timescale. Our simulations identify multiple mechanisms that can generate timescale-specific patterns, including different environmental drivers, diverse life histories, dispersal, and non-stationary dynamics. We find that traditional metrics for quantifying synchronous dynamics are often biased toward long-term drivers and may miss the importance of short-term drivers. Our findings indicate key mechanisms to consider when assessing synchronous versus compensatory dynamics and our approach provides a pathway for disentangling these dynamics in natural systems.},

These findings have fundamental implications for our understanding of animals' lives, suggesting in particular that many animals in these taxa will be found living at densities above the carrying capacity of their environments.}

The strength of these shifts may depend on the availability of individuals with trait values adapted to new environmental conditions, represented by the functional diversity (FD) of existing community residents or dispersal from the regional species pool. We conducted a 3-year nutrient- and seed-addition experiment in old-field plant communities to examine the contributions of species turnover and intraspecific variation to community trait shifts, focusing on four key plant functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We further examined the influence of initial FD and seed availability on the strength of these shifts. Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation. The strength of intraspecific shifts in height and leaf area was positively related to initial intraspecific FD in these traits. Intraspecific trait responses to fertilization varied among species, with species of short stature displaying stronger shifts in SLA and LDMC but weaker shifts in leaf area. Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses. Seed addition altered community taxonomic composition but had little effect on community trait shifts. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses and demonstrate that the strength of these responses may be mediated by community FD.},

The interval analyzed is constituted of 8.5 m of a core drilled in the central portion of the basin, corresponding to the Holocene. 57 levels were randomly sampled and permanent slides were prepared, from which the taxonomic composition of the assemblages and respective densities were performed. A high variability in the density, composition and structure of the diatoms assemblages was established. 292 species were recognized, including 149 with open taxonomic nomenclature, recognized at genus level. These last taxa should correspond to intraspecific variations of known species or new ones, demonstrating the biological richness of these environments, subject to particular stress conditions at high altitude. Along the core, 169 taxa disappeared, representing a loss of 40.9 \% in taxonomic composition. These disappearances are attributed to environmental changes related to temperature, foreign input of volcanic ashes, demineralization and decrease in depth of the water column. In the interval correspondent to the early Holocene, strong environmental disturbances, as well as physical and chemical variations were recorded, with effect on the diatoms assemblage, causing drastic density reduction and change in the compositions towards the levels corresponding to the middle and late Holocene. Changes in the middle Holocene are interpreted as fluctuations in the volume and demineralization of the water body and the external addition of volcanic ashes. In the late Holocene, changes are related to the progressive decrease of the water level in the ecosystem and colonization by macrophytes. \textcopyright{} 2014, (publisher). All rights reserved.}

In particular, ecologists recognise the important role that animal behaviour plays in shaping ecological processes. An emerging area of interest in animal behaviour, the study of behavioural syndromes (animal personalities) considers how limited behavioural plasticity, as well as behavioural correlations affects an individual's fitness in diverse ecological contexts. In this article we explore how insights from the concept and study of behavioural syndromes provide fresh understanding of major issues in population ecology. We identify several general mechanisms for how population ecology phenomena can be influenced by a species or population's average behavioural type, by within-species variation in behavioural type, or by behavioural correlations across time or across ecological contexts. We note, in particular, the importance of behavioural type-dependent dispersal in spatial ecology. We then review recent literature and provide new syntheses for how these general mechanisms produce novel insights on five major issues in population ecology: (1) limits to species' distribution and abundance; (2) species interactions; (3) population dynamics; (4) relative responses to human-induced rapid environmental change; and (5) ecological invasions. \textcopyright{} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, there are several different factors that may constrain the evolution of plasticity, but few models have considered costs and limiting factors simultaneously. Here we use a simulation model to investigate how the optimal level of plasticity in a population depends on a fixed maintenance fitness cost for plasticity or an incremental fitness cost for producing a plastic response in combination with environmental unpredictability (environmental fluctuation speed) limiting plasticity. Our model identifies two mechanisms that act, almost separately, to constrain the evolution of plasticity: (i) the fitness cost of plasticity scaled by the nonplastic environmental tolerance, and (ii) the environmental fluctuation speed scaled by the rate of phenotypic change. That is, the evolution of plasticity is constrained by the high cost of plasticity in combination with high tolerance for environmental variation, or fast environmental changes in combination with slow plastic response. Qualitatively similar results are found when maintenance and incremental fitness costs of plasticity are incorporated, although a larger degree of plasticity is selected for with an incremental cost. Our model highlights that it is important to consider direct fitness costs and phenotypic limitations in relation to nonplastic environmental tolerance and environmental fluctuations, respectively, to understand what constrains the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

Marine sponges are diverse, abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs in both coastal and offshore environments. Due to their exceptionally high filtration rates, sponges also form a crucial coupling point between benthic and pelagic habitats. Sponges harbor extensive microbial communities, with many microbial phylotypes found exclusively in sponges and thought to contribute to the health and survival of their hosts. Manipulative experiments were undertaken to ascertain the impact of elevated nutrients and seawater temperature on health and microbial community dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. R. odorabile exposed to elevated nutrient levels including 10 \textmu mol/L total nitrogen at 31\textdegree C appeared visually similar to those maintained under ambient seawater conditions after 7 days. The symbiotic microbial community, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag sequencing, was highly conserved for the duration of the experiment at both phylum and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (97\% sequence similarity) levels with 19 bacterial phyla and 1743 OTUs identified across all samples. Additionally, elevated nutrients and temperatures did not alter the archaeal associations in R. odorabile, with sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealing similar Thaumarchaeota diversity and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealing consistent amoA gene patterns, across all experimental treatments. A conserved eukaryotic community was also identified across all nutrient and temperature treatments by DGGE. The highly stable microbial associations indicate that R. odorabile symbionts are capable of withstanding short-term exposure to elevated nutrient concentrations and sub-lethal temperatures.},

In this scenario, life adapts to Snowball Earth oceans by evolving large size and faster speeds through multicellularity, which acts to compensate for high-viscosity seawater and achieve fluid flow at sufficient levels to satisfy metabolic needs. Warm, low-viscosity seawater returned with the melting of the Snowball glaciers, and with it, by virtue of large and fast multicellular bodies, new ways of life were unveiled.},

Though viral infections are known to cause behavioural and other changes in phytoplankton and other aquatic species, yet their role in regulating the phytoplankton population is still far from being understood. To study the role of viral diseases in the planktonic species, we model the phytoplankton-zooplankton system as a prey-predator system. Here the prey (phytoplankton) species is infected with a viral disease that divides the prey population into susceptible and infected classes, with the infected prey being more vulnerable to predation by the predator (zooplankton). The dynamical behaviour of the system is investigated from the point of view of stability and persistence both analytically and numerically. The model shows that infection can be sustained only above a threshold of force of infection, and, there exists a range in the infection rate where this system shows "bloom"-like stable limit cycle oscillations. The time series of natural "blooms" with different types of irregular oscillations can arise in this model simply from a biologically realistic feature, i.e., by the random variation of the epidemiological parameter (rate of infection) in the infected prey population. The difference in mean strength of infection alone can lead to the different types of patterns observed in natural planktonic blooms. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Marine Synechococcus owe their specific vivid color (ranging from blue-green to orange) to their large extrinsic antenna complexes called phycobilisomes, comprising a central allophycocyanin core and rods of variable phycobiliprotein composition. Three major pigment types can be defined depending on the major phycobiliprotein found in the rods (phycocyanin, phycoerythrin I or phycoerythrin II). Among strains containing both phycoerythrins I and II, four subtypes can be distinguished based on the ratio of the two chromophores bound to these phycobiliproteins. Genomes of eleven marine Synechococcus strains recently became available with one to four strains per pigment type or subtype, allowing an unprecedented comparative genomics study of genes involved in phycobilisome metabolism. RESULTS: By carefully comparing the Synechococcus genomes, we have retrieved candidate genes potentially required for the synthesis of phycobiliproteins in each pigment type. This includes linker polypeptides, phycobilin lyases and a number of novel genes of uncharacterized function. Interestingly, strains belonging to a given pigment type have similar phycobilisome gene complements and organization, independent of the core genome phylogeny (as assessed using concatenated ribosomal proteins). While phylogenetic trees based on concatenated allophycocyanin protein sequences are congruent with the latter, those based on phycocyanin and phycoerythrin notably differ and match the Synechococcus pigment types. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the phycobilisome core has likely evolved together with the core genome, while rods must have evolved independently, possibly by lateral transfer of phycobilisome rod genes or gene clusters between Synechococcus strains, either via viruses or by natural transformation, allowing rapid adaptation to a variety of light niches.},

The compounds were isolated guided by their ability to inhibit the settlement of cyprid larvae of the barnacle Balanusimprovisus, and their structures were determined by means of mass spectrometry, NMR, and quantitative amino acid analysis. The activities of these brominated diketopiperazine-like cyclic dipeptides are in the range of antifouling agents in use today, as shown by their EC(50) values of 0.9 and 7.9 microM, respectively. However, contrary to today's antifouling agents, the effects of barettin and 8,9-dihydrobarettin are nontoxic and reversible. A small set of synthetic analogues, including l-arginine, l-tryptophan, 5-bromo-d,l-tryptophan, 6-bromo-d,l-tryptophan, and 6-fluoro-d,l-tryptophan, were tested for possible structure-activity relationships. None of these compounds showed any effect at a concentration of 10 microM. We hypothesize that the isolated compounds are part of the sponge's chemical defense to deter fouling organisms. This theory is supported by the fact that barettin is found in water exposed to living specimens of G. barretti in concentrations that completely inhibit barnacles from settling.},

Data from three lake districts are used in this paper: the Tatra Mts. in Slovakia and Poland (45 lakes), the Alps in Tyrol in Austria (22 lakes), and Scotland (30 lakes). As it is shown by multiple regression analysis, DTOC (dissolved or total organic carbon) is the key variable for most groups of zooplankton. With increasing DTOC and mostly with chlorophyll-a decreasing, pH increasing and depth decreasing, macrofitrators with coarse filter meshes are replaced by microfiltrators with fine filter meshes. Higher DTOC may increase bacterioplankton production and advantage species able to consume bacteria (microfiltrators). Other zooplankton species also differ in their preference for DTOC, chlorophyll-a, pH and depth, but DTOC being positively correlated with chlorophyll-a and pH positively correlated with depth. It may be caused by their different preference for food quality in terms of C:P ratio.},

(red BA-120, green BA-124 and brown BA-132) were cultivated in a laboratory under previously determined environmental conditions. These conditions were as follows: temperature (T) from 10 by 5 to 25\&amp;thinsp;\textdegree C, salinity from 3 by 5 to 18 and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) from 10 by 90 to 280\&amp;thinsp;{$\mu$}mol\&amp;thinsp;photons\&amp;thinsp;m\textsuperscript{\&amp;minus;2}\&amp;thinsp;s\textsuperscript{\&amp;minus;1}, which gave 64 combinations of synthetic, though real environmental conditions. Scenarios reflecting all possible combinations were applied in the laboratory experiments. Results pointed to differences in growth rates between strains. However, there was also a similar pattern for BA-124 and BA-132, which showed the highest concentrations of picocyanobacteria cells at higher T and PAR. This was also found to be true for BA-120, but only to a certain degree as the growth rates started to decrease above 190\&amp;thinsp;{$\mu$}mol\&amp;thinsp;photons\&amp;thinsp;m\textsuperscript{\&amp;minus;2}\&amp;thinsp;s\textsuperscript{\&amp;minus;1} PAR.

Blooms of these organisms are observed in tropical, subtropical and even temperate zones, and they have been recorded recently even beyond the polar circle. The long-term scenarios forecast a growing expansion of Synechococcus sp. and its area of dominance. This is, among others, due to their high physiological plasticity in relation to changing environmental conditions. Three phenotypes of the genus Synechococcus sp. (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3a) were tested in controlled laboratory conditions in order to identify their response to various irradiance (10, 55, 100 and 145 \textmu mol photons m-2 s-1) and temperature (15, 22.5 and 30 \textdegree C) conditions. The highest total pigment content per cell was recorded at 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at all temperature variants with the clear dominance of phycobilins among all the pigments. In almost every variant the highest growth rate was recorded for the Type 1. The lowest growth rates were observed, in general, for the Type 3a. However, it was recognized to be less temperature sensitive in comparison to the other two types and rather light-driven with the highest plasticity and adaptation potential. The highest amounts of carotenoids were produced by Type 2 which also showed signs of the cell stress even around 55 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at 15 \textdegree C and 22.5 \textdegree C. This may imply that the Type 2 is the most susceptible to higher irradiances. Picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. require less light intensity to achieve the maximum rate of photosynthesis than larger algae. They also tolerate a wide range of temperatures which combined together make them gain a powerful competitive advantage. Our results will provide key information for the ecohydrodynamical model development. Thus, this work would be an important link in forecasting future changes in the occurrence of these organisms in the context of global warming.},

  abstract = {Photoacclimation models for marine phytoplankton describe the changes in their composition (typcially C, N and chlorophyll) and growth in response to changing light and nutrient environment. We compared two such models: that of Geider et al. (Geider, R.J., MacIntyre, H.L., Kana, T.M., 1998. A dynamic regulatory model of phytoplankton acclimation to light, nutrients, and temperature. Limnol. Oceanogr. 43, 679-694), hereafter the G model, and that of Pahlow (Pahlow, M., 2005. Linking chlorophyll-nutrient dynamics to the redfield N:C ratio with a model of optimal phytoplankton growth. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 287, 33-43), hereafter the P model. Using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, we fitted both models to the data set from an incubation experiment by Flynn et al. (Flynn, K.J., Davidson, K., Leftley, J.W., 1994. Carbon-nitrogen relations at whole-cell and free amino-acid levels, during batch growth of isochrysis galbanna (prymnesiophyceae) under conditions of alternating light and dark. Mar. Biol. 118, 229-237). Data consisted of measured concentrations for particulate organic N, particulate organic C, chlorophyll and ammonium. The authors of the G model began their simulation from day 5 for this experiment, claiming that their model could not reproduce the initial lag phase (slow growth during the first few days of the experiment). The author of the P model claimed that its ability to reproduce this initial lag phase (starting from the beginning of the experiment) was a significant improvement over previous models. Our fitting revealed that the G model can reproduce this initial lag phase as well as the P model, and that both models simulate the data set well. In the best-fits of both models, chlorophyll synthesis during the initial lag phase was limited by the rate of carbon assimilation, even though the G model was designed to have chlorophyll synthesis limited only by the rate of N assimilation. The requirement of organic carbon for energy to assimilate nitrogen results in this indirect limitation of chlorophyll synthesis by C assimilation in the G model, whereas chlorophyll synthesis is explicitly limited by the rate of C assimilation in the P model. This suggests that chlorophyll synthesis is in fact limited by the rate of C assimilation during the initial lag phase. As in the hand-tuned simulations previously published, the P model simulated the initial decrease in Chl:N ratio (as observed) whereas the G model simulated an initial increase in this ratio (contrary to the observations). We also discuss the relative merits of the two models for applications at large scales. Although data assimilation is not perfectly objective, because it requires certain choices such as weights for various data types and which data to include when fitting, our results show the advantage of mathematically rigorous fitting as opposed to hand-tuning of models. Our best-fits were significantly better than the hand-tuned fits originally published, especially for the G model, and this yielded insight into the mechanism responsible for the initial lag in phytoplankton growth. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The rate of global-mean temperature increase in the CMIP5 (ref. 3) archive over 40-year periods increases to 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.05 \textdegree C (1{$\sigma$}) per decade by 2020, an average greater than peak rates of change during the previous one to two millennia.

We compared predictions from species and phenotype distribution models under future climate scenarios for Andropogon gerardii, a widely distributed, dominant grass found throughout the central United States. Phenotype data on aboveground biomass, height, leaf width, and chlorophyll content were obtained from 33 populations spanning a \textasciitilde 1000 km gradient that encompassed the majority of the species' environmental range. Species and phenotype distribution models were trained using current climate conditions and projected to future climate scenarios. We used permutation procedures to infer the most important variable for each model. The species-level response to climate was most sensitive to maximum temperature of the hottest month, but phenotypic variables were most sensitive to mean annual precipitation. The phenotype distribution models predict that A. gerardii could be largely functionally eliminated from where this species currently dominates, with biomass and height declining by up to \textasciitilde 60\% and leaf width by \textasciitilde 20\%. By the 2070s, the core area of highest suitability for A. gerardii is projected to shift up to \textasciitilde 700 km northeastward. Further, short-statured phenotypes found in the present-day short grass prairies on the western periphery of the species' range will become favored in the current core \textasciitilde 800 km eastward of their current location. Combined, species and phenotype models predict this currently dominant prairie grass will decline in prevalence and stature. Thus, sourcing plant material for grassland restoration and forage should consider changes in the phenotype that will be favored under future climate conditions. Phenotype distribution models account for the role of intraspecific variation in determining responses to anticipated climate change and thereby complement predictions from species distributions models in guiding climate adaptation strategies.},

Many researchers have assumed that the Permo-Triassic mass extinction (PTME) and end-Triassic extinction (ETE) had little impact on actinopterygians, despite devastating many other groups. Here, two morphometric techniques, geometric (body shape) and functional (jaw morphology), are used to assess the effects of these two extinction events on the group. The PTME elicits no significant shifts in functional disparity while body shape disparity increases. An expansion of body shape and functional disparity coincides with the neopterygian radiation and evolution of novel feeding adaptations in the Middle-Late Triassic. Through the ETE, small decreases are seen in shape and functional disparity, but are unlikely to represent major changes brought about by the extinction event. In the Early Jurassic, further expansions into novel areas of ecospace indicative of durophagy occur, potentially linked to losses in the ETE. As no evidence is found for major perturbations in actinopterygian evolution through either extinction event, the group appears to have been immune to two major environmental crises that were disastrous to most other organisms.},

This operator theoretic point of view lifts the dynamics of a finite-dimensional nonlinear system to an infinite-dimensional function space where the evolution of the original system becomes linear. In this paper, we provide a brief summary of the Koopman operator theorem for nonlinear dynamics modeling and focus on analyzing several data-driven implementations using dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) for autonomous and controlled canonical problems. We apply the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to identify the leading Koopman eigenfunctions and approximate a finite-dimensional representation of the discovered linear dynamics. This allows us to apply linear control approaches towards nonlinear systems without linearization approximations around fixed points. We can then examine the fidelity of using a linear controller based on a Koopman operator approximated system on under-actuated systems with basic maneuvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this theory through numerical simulation on two classic dynamical systems are used to show DMD methods of evaluating and approximating the Koopman operator and its effectiveness at linearizing these systems.},

Thus, light supply was the composite result of two components: photoperiod and intensity. Diatoms were dominant competitors at higher Si: N ratios, nonsiliceous flagellates at lower ones. Light had no impact on the transition from flagellate to diatom dominance along the Si: N gradient. However, species within those groups were separated along the light gradient. Contrary to theoretical expectations, changes in light intensity and changes in daylength led to similar shifts in species dominance. Therefore, it was possible to describe the light climate by the integral parameter "daily light dose."},

Phytoplankton biomass during the experimental period decreased with warming and with higher densities of overwintering zooplankton. Similarly, average cell size and average effective particle size (here: colony size) decreased both with zooplankton density and warming. A decrease in phytoplankton particle size is generally considered at typical footprint of copepod grazing.

It emphasized the role of physical factors, grazing and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton, and the role of food limitation and fish predation for zooplankton. Although originally targeted at lake ecosystems, it was also adopted by marine plankton ecologists. Since then, a suite of ecological interactions previously underestimated in importance have become research foci: overwintering of key organisms, the microbial food web, parasitism, and food quality as a limiting factor and an extended role of higher order predators.

This contribution is intended as a fresh view and will discuss current and future challenges of plasticity research, and the need to identify associated molecular mechanisms. After a brief summary of conceptual, theoretical, and historical aspects, some of which were responsible for confusion and contention, I will formulate three major research directions and predictions for the role of plasticity as a facilitator of novelty. These predictions result in a four-step model that, when properly filled with molecular mechanisms, will reveal plasticity as a major factor of evolution. Such mechanistic insight must be complemented with comparative investigations to show that plasticity has indeed created novelty and innovation.

The overlooked property is that stabilizing mechanisms (increasing species' niche differences) and equalizing mechanisms (reducing species' fitness differences) have two distinct sets of meanings within MCT: one in a 2-species, and another in a general multispecies context. We demonstrate that the 2-species framework is not a special case of the multispecies one, and therefore these two parallel frameworks must be studied independently. Our first result is that, using the 2-species framework and mechanistic consumer-resource models, stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms exhibit complex interdependence, such that changing one will simultaneously change the other. Furthermore, the nature and direction of this simultaneous change depend sensitively on model parameters. The second result states that while MCT is often seen as bridging niche and neutral modes of coexistence by building a niche-neutrality continuum, the interdependence between stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms acts to break this continuum under almost any biologically relevant circumstance. We conclude that the complex entanglement of stabilizing and equalizing terms makes their impact on coexistence difficult to understand, but by seeing them as aggregated effects (rather than underlying causes) of coexistence, we may increase our understanding of ecological dynamics. 2},

We simulated data with various types of within-paper nonindependence, and assessed the standard deviation of the estimated mean effect size and Type I error rate of each method. Although all four methods performed substantially better than the standard random-effects model that assumes independence, there were differences in performance among the methods. A two-step method that first summarizes the multiple observed effect sizes per paper using a weighted mean and then analyzes the reduced data in a standard random-effects model, and a robust variance estimation method performed consistently well. A hierarchical model with both random paper and study effects gave precise estimates but had a higher Type I error rates, possibly reflecting limitations of currently available meta-analysis software. Overall, we advocate the use of the two-step method with a weighted paper mean and the robust variance estimation method as reliable ways to handle within-paper nonindependence in ecological meta-analyses.},

Since immigration history is rarely known, these historical influences, or priority effects, pose a major challenge in predicting community assembly. Here, we provide a graph-\-based, non-\-parametric, theoretical framework for understanding the predictability of community assembly as affected by priority effects. To develop this framework, we first show that the diversity of possible priority effects increases super-\-exponentially with the number of species. We then point out that, despite this diversity, the consequences of priority effects for multispecies communities can be classified into four basic types, each of which reduces community predictability: alternative stable states, alternative transient paths, compositional cycles and the lack of escapes from compositional cycles to stable states. Using a neural network, we show that this classification of priority effects enables accurate explanation of community predictability, particularly when each species immigrates repeatedly. We also demonstrate the empirical utility of our theoretical framework by applying it to two experimentally derived assembly graphs of algal and ciliate communities. Based on these analyses, we discuss how the framework proposed here can help guide experimental investigation of the predictability of history-\- dependent community assembly.},

Microbial response to and its recovery after hydrologic perturbations (i.e., resilience) is a critical component to understand in this regard, but generally difficult to predict because the impacts of future events can be dependent on the history of perturbations (i.e., historical contingency). Fundamental issues underlying this phenomenon include how microbial resilience to hydrologic perturbations is influenced by historical contingency and how their relationships vary depending on the characteristics of microbial functions. To answer these questions, we considered a simple microbial community composed of two species that redundantly consume a common substrate but specialize in producing distinct products and developed a continuous flow reactor model where the two species grow with trade-offs along the flow rate. Simulations of this model revealed that (1) the history of hydrologic perturbations can lead to the shifts in microbial populations, which consequently affect the community's functional dynamics, and (2) while historical contingency in resilience was consistently predicted for all microbial functions, it was more pronounced for specialized functions, compared to the redundant function. As a signature of historical contingency, our model also predicted the emergence of hysteresis in the transitions across conditions, a critical aspect that can affect transient formation of intermediate compounds in biogeochemistry. This work presents microbial growth traits and their functional redundancy or specialization as fundamental factors that control historical contingencies in resilience.},

However, environmental change may affect ecosystem function without affecting richness, most notably by affecting population densities and community composition. Using a theoretical model, we find that, despite invariant richness, (1) small environmental effects may already lead to a collapse of function; (2) competitive strength may be a less important determinant of ecosystem function change than the selectivity of the environmental change driver and (3) effects on ecosystem function increase when effects on composition are larger. We also present a complementary statistical analysis of 13 data sets of phytoplankton and periphyton communities exposed to chemical stressors and show that effects on primary production under invariant richness ranged from -75\% to +10\%. We conclude that environmental protection goals relying on measures of richness could underestimate ecological impacts of environmental change.},

  abstract = {Species coexistence is the indefinite co-occurrence of two or more species in the same location at the same time. Modern coexistence theory explains this by niche and fitness differences, which measure how similar the resource requirements of species are and how different their intrinsic fitness is. Species coexist if their niche differences overcome fitness differences, which promote and hamper coexistence respectively. In my PhD thesis, I first propose an intuitive a and broadly applicable definition of niche and fitness differences to subsequently apply it to various community types that were so far out of the reach of modern coexistence theory (Chapter 2). I then compare this new approach with the traditional approach to measure niche and fitness differences. Specifically, I investigate the effect of higher order and non-linear interactions on niche and fitness differences, their effect on the outcome of species interactions and how we interpret their coexistence. Most importantly, I show that the omission of higher order interactions, when computing niche and fitness differences, leads to qualitatively wrong predictions concerning whether and why species coexist (Chapter 3). In chapter 4, I show that species richness increases fitness differences, but not niche differences. This is an important step from simple two-species communities towards the higher complexity of natural communities. MCT and biodiversity ecosystem function are closely related, as they both use niche differences to explain their results. Nonetheless, there are very few collaborations between the two fields. In chapter 5, I investigate the effects of trait richness on coexistence, niche and fitness differences, and ecosystem function to close the gap between coexistence theory and biodiversity ecosystem functioning. In chapter 6, I extend the focus of MCT towards the entire community. Most importantly, to communities with facilitative species interactions or species that depend on the presence of other species.},

Species with dissimilar traits would partition available resources, increasing niche differences, facilitating coexistence and increasing ecosystem function. Here we first show, using theory and simulations for light-limited phytoplankton, that combing photosynthetic pigments is indeed a necessary condition for coexistence and stimulates ecosystem function. However, pigment richness does mostly not permit the coexistence of more than two species, and increases productivity at most 40\% compared to single-pigment communities. That is because blending in more pigments leads to coexistence of species with many pigments and therefore flat absorption spectra, which equalizes their fitness but decreases their niche differences. Similarly, seeding species with more variable size leads to an excess of large-celled species, which does not only decrease fitness differences but also niche differences. Empirical data and additional simulations suggest that pigment richness effects can be stronger during transient dynamics but inevitably weaken with time, that is, pigment richness effects on species richness and function are likely short-lived. Synthesis. Our results highlight the need to apply coexistence theory to understand the long-term effects of trait diversity on biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Understanding organismal responses to environmental drivers is relevant to predict species capacities to respond to climate change. However, the scarce information available on intraspecific variation in the responses oversimplifies our view of the actual species capacities. We studied intraspecific variation in survival and larval development of a marine coastal invertebrate (shore crab Carcinus maenas) in response to two key environmental drivers (temperature and salinity) characterising coastal habitats. On average, survival of early larval stages (up to zoea IV) exhibited an antagonistic response by which negative effects of low salinity were mitigated at increased temperatures. Such response would be adaptive for species inhabiting coastal regions of freshwater influence under summer conditions and moderate warming. Average responses of developmental time were also antagonistic and may be categorised as a form of thermal mitigation of osmotic stress. The capacity for thermal mitigation of low-salinity stress varied among larvae produced by different females. For survival in particular, deviations did not only consist of variations in the magnitude of the mitigation effect; instead, the range of responses varied from strong effects to no effects of salinity across the thermal range tested. Quantifying intraspecific variation of such capacity is a critical step in understanding responses to climate change: it points towards either an important potential for selection or a critical role of environmental change, operating in the parental environment and leading to stress responses in larvae.},

However, this ignores known and substantial intraspecific variation that can have important consequences for species interactions and community composition. This within-species variation results from two distinct sources: ontogeny and consistent individual differences. Ontogeny and consistent differences interact to produce phenotypes, but the community-level consequences of this interaction have not been studied. Using larval dragonfly communities, I investigate patterns of intraguild predation by manipulating (1) consistent individual differences in activity rate and (2) the ontogeny of the focal and interacting species. I show that activity rate is a consistent individual trait but that the effect of activity rate on intraguild predation depends on the functional role of an organism in the community (predator or prey). An organism's functional role itself varies across ontogeny of both the focal and interacting individuals. I suggest that ontogeny and consistent individual differences interact to produce intraspecific variation, with consequences for species interactions, communities, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2018 by The University of Chicago.

The effect of such intraspecific trait variability (ITV) on the stability, coexistence, and diversity of ecological communities received considerable attention and in many models it was shown to impede coexistence and decrease species diversity. Here we present a numerical study of the effect of genetically inherited ITV on species persistence and diversity in a temporally fluctuating environment. Two mechanisms are identified. First, ITV buffers populations against varying environmental conditions (portfolio effect) and reduces variation in abundances. Second, the interplay between ITV and environmental variations tends to increase the mean fitness of diverse populations. The first mechanism promotes persistence and tends to increase species richness, while the second reduces the chance of a rare species population (which is usually homogeneous) to invade, thus decreasing species richness. We show that for large communities the portfolio effect is dominant, leading to ITV promoting species persistence and richness.},

The puzzle has been enlarged rather than solved by the progressive discovery of new phototrophic microorganisms in the oceans, including picocyanobacteria, pico-eukaryotes, and bacteriochlorophyll-based and rhodopsin-based phototrophic bacteria. Physiological and genomic studies suggest that natural selection promotes niche differentiation among these phototrophic microorganisms, particularly with respect to their photosynthetic characteristics. We have analysed competition for light between two closely related picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group that we isolated from the Baltic Sea. One of these two has a red colour because it contains the pigment phycoerythrin, whereas the other is blue-green because it contains high contents of the pigment phycocyanin. Here we report theory and competition experiments that reveal stable coexistence of the two picocyanobacteria, owing to partitioning of the light spectrum. Further competition experiments with a third marine cyanobacterium, capable of adapting its pigment composition, show that this species persists by investing in the pigment that absorbs the colour not used by its competitors. These results demonstrate the adaptive significance of divergence in pigment composition of phototrophic microorganisms, which allows an efficient utilization of light energy and favours species coexistence.},

To test this prediction, we sampled picocyanobacteria of 70 aquatic ecosystems, ranging from clear blue oceans to turbid brown peat lakes. As predicted, red picocyanobacteria dominated in clear waters, whereas green picocyanobacteria dominated in turbid waters. We found widespread coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria in waters of intermediate turbidity.

Utilization of the light spectrum can be interpreted in terms of classical niche theory, as the light spectrum offers opportunities for niche differentiation and allows coexistence of species absorbing different colors of light. However, which spectral niches are available for phototrophic microorganisms? Here, we show that the answer is hidden in the vibrations of the water molecule. Water molecules absorb light at specific wavebands that match the energy required for their stretching and bending vibrations. Although light absorption at these specific wavelengths appears only as subtle shoulders in the absorption spectrum of pure water, these subtle shoulders create large gaps in the underwater light spectrum due to the exponential nature of light attenuation. Model calculations show that the wavebands between these gaps define a series of distinct niches in the underwater light spectrum. Strikingly, these distinct spectral niches match the light absorption spectra of the major photosynthetic pigments on our planet. This suggests that vibrations of the water molecule have played a major role in the ecology and evolution of phototrophic microorganisms. \textcopyright{} 2007 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In the 70's, Robert May demonstrated that complexity creates instability in generic models of ecological networks having random interaction matrices A. Similar random matrix models have since been applied in many disciplines. Central to assessing stability is the ``circular law\{''\} since it describes the eigenvalue distribution for an important class of random matrices A. However, despite widespread adoption, the ``circular law\{''\} does not apply for ecological systems in which density-dependence operates (i.e., where a species growth is determined by its density). Instead one needs to study the far more complicated eigenvalue distribution of the community matrix S=DA, where D is a diagonal matrix of population equilibrium values. Here we obtain this eigenvalue distribution. We show that if the random matrix A is locally stable, the community matrix S=DA will also be locally stable, providing the system is feasible (i.e., all species have positive equilibria D {$>$} 0). This helps explain why, unusually, nearly all feasible systems studied here are locally stable. Large complex systems may thus be even more fragile than May predicted, given the difficulty of assembling a feasible system. It was also found that the degree of stability, or resilience of a system, depended on the minimum equilibrium population.},

Two short (76 and 73 bp) and one longer (577 bp) fragments of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) gene, encoding the large subunit of the rbcL, were used as genetic markers. Diverse morphological assemblages of diatoms, dominated by small benthic fragilarioid taxa, were retrieved from the sediments of each lake. These minute fragilarioid taxa were examined by scanning electron microscopy, revealing diverse morphotypes in Staurosira and Staurosirella from the different lakes. Genetic analyses indicated a dominance of haplotypes that were assigned to fragilarioid taxa and less genetic diversity in other diatom taxa. The long rbcL{$_5$}77 amplicon identified considerable diversification among haplotypes clustering within the Staurosira/Staurosirella genera, revealing 19 different haplotypes whose spatial distribution appears to be primarily related to the latitude of the lakes, which corresponds to a vegetation and climate gradient. Our rbcL markers are valuable tools for tracking differences between diatom lineages that are not visible in their morphologies. These markers revealed putatively high genetic diversity within the Staurosira/Staurosirella species complex, at a finer scale than is possible to resolve by microscopic determination. The rbcL markers may provide additional reliable information on the diversity of barely distinguishable minute benthic fragilarioids. Environmental sequencing may thus allow the tracking of spatial and temporal diversification in Siberian lakes, especially in the context of diatom responses to recent environmental changes, which remains a matter of controversy. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

A weed traits database (WTDB) was designed, populated and analysed, initially using data for 19 common European weeds, to begin to consolidate trait data in a single repository. The initial choice of traits was driven by the requirements of empirical models of weed population dynamics to identify correlations between traits and model parameters. These relationships were used to build a generic model, operating at the level of functional traits, to simulate the impact of increasing herbicide and fertiliser use on virtual weeds along gradients of seed weight and maximum height. The model generated 'fitness contours' (defined as population growth rates) within this trait space in different scenarios, onto which two sets of weed species, defined as common or declining in the UK, were mapped. The effect of increasing inputs on the weed flora was successfully simulated; 77\% of common species were predicted to have stable or increasing populations under high fertiliser and herbicide use, in contrast with only 29\% of the species that have declined. Future development of the WTDB will aim to increase the number of species covered, incorporate a wider range of traits and analyse intraspecific variability under contrasting management and environments.},

The analysis covered, within a single mid-summer period, particulate organic matter (POM) and 38 taxa, ranging from suspension feeding copepods and salps to omnivorous euphausiids, pelagic fish and higher, land-based predators including fur seals, penguins and flying birds. Spatial variation in [delta]15N of POM correlated well with nutrient availability and primary productivity. Latitudinal differences in [delta]13C of POM were closely linked to variations in temperature, nutrients and productivity depending on the frontal region sampled. This translated to equivalent (although smaller) regional [delta]13C differences among higher trophic levels. Species trophic positions based on isotope values broadly agreed with previously published dietary data with three important exceptions. First, the carnivorous amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii had anomalously low [delta]15N values. Second, Euphausia superba had [delta]15N values that were also surprisingly low, considering the abundant literature suggesting its omnivory. Third, the copepod Rhincalanus gigas, considered a suspension feeder, had unexpectedly high [delta]15N values rather more in keeping with omnivorous feeding. The consumer [delta]15N values ranged from 1.2[per mille sign] (min.) measured in Salpa thompsoni (designated here as trophic level (TL) 2 across all regions) to 15.2[per mille sign] (max.) measured in white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis, calculated as TL5 relative to the TL2 of salps). Excluding seabirds, the resulting food chain length of 3.7 TL (above POM at TL1) was lower than in most other Southern Ocean and temperate marine pelagic ecosystems. The majority (60\%) of vertebrate predators occupied only 1 to 1.5 trophic levels above the herbivorous suspension feeders such as krill. This indicates the existence of the classic short food chain of POM-suspension feeder-vertebrate predator. However the presence of trophic levels 4 and above indicates the existence of alternative trophic pathways, for example involving myctophid fish or carrion, and that some wide-ranging predators which breed at South Georgia also feed outside the region. This conclusion is supported first by the continuum of [delta]15N values between krill, suspension feeding copepods and myctophid fish, and secondly by higher trophic levels in several of the myctophid species in the low-krill region of the northern Scotia Sea, suggesting latitudinal differences in food web structure and food chain length.},

No visible signs of stress (tissue necrosis or discolouration) were evident across experimental treatments; however, significant interactive effects of time and treatment on respiration, nutrient production and cellular stress were detected. Respiration rates and nitrogen effluxes doubled in responses to elevated temperatures (11 \textdegree C \& 12 \textdegree C) compared to control temperatures (7 \textdegree C). Cellular stress, as measured through lysosomal destabilisation, was 2\textendash 5 times higher at elevated temperatures than for control temperatures. However, the microbiome of G. barretti remained stable throughout the experiment, irrespective of temperature treatment. Mortality was not evident and respiration rates returned to pre-experimental levels during recovery.

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the tropical and subtropical oceans, accounting for half of the photosynthetic biomass in some areas. Here we report the isolation of cyanophages that infect Prochlorococcus, and show that although some are host-strain-specific, others cross-infect with closely related marine Synechococcus as well as between high-light- and low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus isolates, suggesting a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. High-light-adapted Prochlorococcus hosts yielded Podoviridae exclusively, which were extremely host-specific, whereas low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus and all strains of Synechococcus yielded primarily Myoviridae, which has a broad host range. Finally, both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strain-specific cyanophage titres were low (\textexclamdown{} 10(3) ml(-1)) in stratified oligotrophic waters even where total cyanobacterial abundances were high (\textquestiondown{} 10(5) cells x ml(-1)). These low titres in areas of high total host cell abundance seem to be a feature of open ocean ecosystems. We hypothesize that gradients in cyanobacterial population diversity, growth rates, and/or the incidence of lysogeny underlie these trends.},

  abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of the ocean's major cations - calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium - are linked to the ocean's alkalinity budget through terrestrial weathering and the subsequent formation and burial of calcium carbonate in the ocean. Chemical reactions within ocean sediments play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycles of the major cations, as indicated by geochemical gradients (both positive and negative) in the concentrations of these cations within the pore-fluid system (i.e. fluid trapped between sediment particles). Here we review the biogeochemical cycles of calcium, magnesium, and sodium, and provide new estimates of the diffusive fluxes of these cations within marine sediments to explore the importance of these sedimentary processes. We quantify these fluxes by compiling a global database of pore fluids from the various Ocean Drilling Programs (Deep Sea Drilling Program - DSDP, Ocean Drilling Program - ODP, International Ocean Drilling Program - IODP), comprising nearly 700 locations, which allows a wider geographic coverage and therefore better integrated flux estimates than previous work has allowed. The myriad of subseafloor chemical reactions that may influence the concentrations of the major cations in pore fluids include authigenic carbonate precipitation, carbonate dissolution, clay mineral formation, and ion exchange as previous work has shown, we confirm that these integrated fluxes are globally significant. Because the DSDP/ODP/IODP cores begin sampling one meter below the sediment-water interface, additional studies of the processes within the top meter are needed to accurately calculate total cation fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Delineating the various processes that control the major cation chemistry of seawater over geologic time scales remains critical for understanding the operation of the CO2silicate-weathering thermostat on geologic timescales.},

  abstract = {Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is raising seawater CO(2) concentrations and thereby acidifying ocean water. But a second environmental problem, eutrophication, is also causing large CO(2) inputs into coastal waters. This occurs because anthropogenic inputs of nutrients have fueled massive algal blooms, which deplete bottom waters of oxygen (O(2)) and release CO(2) when the organic matter from these blooms is respired by bacteria. On the basis of a biogeochemical model, these CO(2) inputs are predicted to decrease current pH values by 0.25 to 1.1 units, effects that increased with decreasing temperature and salinity. Our model predictions agreed well with pH data from hypoxic zones in the northern Gulf of Mexico and Baltic Sea, two eutrophic coastal systems with large temperature and salinity differences. The modeled and measured decreases in pH are well within the range shown to adversely impact marine fauna. Model calculations show that the acidification from respiratory CO(2) inputs interacts in a complex fashion with that from increasing atmospheric CO(2) and that these pH effects can be more than additive in seawater at intermediate to higher temperatures. These interactions have important biological implications in a future world with increasing atmospheric CO(2), increasing anthropogenic inputs of nutrients, and rising temperatures from CO(2)-linked global warming.},

Because Paramecium has a transcriptionally silent germ-line nucleus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection operates on the cumulative germ-line replication fidelity per episode of somatic gene expression, with the germ-line mutation rate per cell division evolving downward to the lower barrier imposed by random genetic drift. We observe ciliate-specific modifications of widely conserved amino acid sites in DNA polymerases as one potential explanation for unusually high levels of replication fidelity.},

Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although they are the ones whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation of cod stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased discarding of juvenile cod. Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective landings control system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In contrast to the number of biomarker development studies, the number of biomarker validation studies has remained limited. This paper redresses this imbalance by drawing together data from studies that have used the earthworm lysosomal membrane stability response (measured using the neutral red retention assay). This review first gives a short history of the biomarker's development. Second, it sets published applications of the technique against established criteria for a "good" biomarker (i.e., dose-response relationship, sensitivity, ecological relevance, confounding factors, chemical specificity, species differences, time-response relationship, methodological concerns, and overall public/regulator confidence, and acceptance). Discussion of the biomarker's suitability to each criterion is followed by an overall evaluation of its workability for routine soil quality assessment and caveats for its use. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Abstract Background Functional traits are phenotypic traits that affect an organism's performance and shape ecosystem-level processes. The main challenge when using functional traits to quantify biodiversity is to choose which ones to meas- ure since effort and money are limited. As one way of dealing with this, Hodgson et al. (Oikos 85:282, 1999) introduced the idea of two types of traits, with soft traits that are easy and quick to quantify, and hard traits that are directly linked to ecosystem functioning but difficult to measure. If a link exists between the two types of traits, then one could use soft traits as a proxy for hard traits for a quick but meaningful assessment of biodiversity. However, this framework is based on two assumptions: (1) hard and soft traits must be tightly connected to allow reliable prediction of one using the other; (2) the relationship between traits must be monotonic and linear to be detected by the most common statistical techniques (e.g. linear model, PCA). Results Here we addressed those two assumptions by focusing on six functional traits of the protist species Tetrahy- mena thermophila, which vary both in their measurement difficulty and functional meaningfulness. They were classi- fied as: easy traits (morphological traits), intermediate traits (movement traits) and hard traits (oxygen consumption and population growth rate). We detected a high number (\textquestiondown{} 60\%) of non-linear relations between the traits, which can explain the low number of significant relations found using linear models and PCA analysis. Overall, these analy- ses did not detect any relationship strong enough to predict one trait using another, but that does not imply there are none. Conclusions Our results highlighted the need to critically assess the relations among the functional traits used as proxies and those functional traits which they aim to reflect. A thorough assessment of whether such relations exist across species and communities is a necessary next step to evaluate whether it is possible to take a shortcut in quan- tifying functional diversity by collecting the data on easily measurable traits.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM: statistical and/or mechanistic approaches to the assessment of range determinants and prediction of species occurrence) offers new possibilities for estimating and studying past organism distributions. SDM complements fossil and genetic evidence by providing (i) quantitative and potentially high-resolution predictions of the past organism distributions, (ii) statistically formulated, testable ecological hypotheses regarding past distributions and communities, and (iii) statistical assessment of range determinants. In this article, we provide an overview of applications of SDM to paleobiology, outlining the methodology, reviewing SDM-based studies to paleobiology or at the interface of paleo- and neobiology, discussing assumptions and uncertainties as well as how to handle them, and providing a synthesis and outlook. Key methodological issues for SDM applications to paleobiology include predictor variables (types and properties; special emphasis is given to paleoclimate), model validation (particularly important given the emphasis on cross-temporal predictions in paleobiological applications), and the integration of SDM and genetics approaches. Over the last few years the number of studies using SDM to address paleobiology-related questions has increased considerably. While some of these studies only use SDM (23\%), most combine them with genetically inferred patterns (49\%), paleoecological records (22\%), or both (6\%). A large number of SDM-based studies have addressed the role of Pleistocene glacial refugia in biogeography and evolution, especially in Europe, but also in many other regions. SDM-based approaches are also beginning to contribute to a suite of other research questions, such as historical constraints on current distributions and diversity patterns, the end-Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions, past community assembly, human paleobiogeography, Holocene paleoecology, and even deep-time biogeography (notably, providing insights into biogeographic dynamics {$>$}400 million years ago). We discuss important assumptions and uncertainties that affect the SDM approach to paleobiology - the equilibrium postulate, niche stability, changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations - as well as ways to address these (ensemble, functional SDM, and non-SDM ecoinformatics approaches). We conclude that the SDM approach offers important opportunities for advances in paleobiology by providing a quantitative ecological perspective, and hereby also offers the potential for an enhanced contribution of paleobiology to ecology and conservation biology, e.g., for estimating climate change impacts and for informing ecological restoration. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {High salinity increases antioxidative activities in plants; however, their significance for overall plant salt tolerance remains to be established. This work provided in vivo evidence of salinity induced biphasic reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation evoking oxidative stress in the cyanobacterium Anabaena fertilissima. First, a transient increase in ROS (intense and short-lived) was observed within 5 min of salt exposure, which peaked within 15 min and reached basal level by 2 h. This was followed by a second relatively long-lived and low magnitude ROS accumulation that started at 4 h of salt stress, attained its maximal at 6 h, followed by a gradual decline but did not attain the basal level by the end of experimentation (12 h). Phase I ROS accumulation timing corresponded to the reaction of cyanobacterial cells to the salt stress, while altered photosynthetic and respiratory parameters corresponded with the phase II ROS generation. Relatively lower magnitude of ROS generation during phase II may be attributed to the rapid activation of robust antioxidative systems in cyanobacteria. Consequently, ROS generation lead to the activation of programmed cell death (PCD) undergoing various apoptotic stages such as externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA laddering and loss of plasma membrane integrity. A. fertilissima exposed to salt in the presence of SO4\textasciimacron{} was relatively better equipped to deal with salt stress.},

However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as "feature types" in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.},

We find that the constant and slowly warming environments show similar responses in terms of population dynamics, whereas populations with linear and fast warming quickly decline and show a stronger temperature-size response. Our analyses suggest that acclimation may have played a role in observing these differences among treatments. The SD hypothesis is most parsimonious with the data, however, neither the DDG nor the MASROS hypothesis can be firmly dismissed. We conclude that the TSR is driven by multiple ecological and acclimatory responses, hence multicausal. A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that intraspecific genetic diversity in one species may leave a substantial imprint on the surrounding community and ecosystem. Here, we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity within host-plant patches translates into consistent and ecologically important changes in the associated herbivore community. More specifically, we use potted, grafted oak saplings to construct 41 patches of four saplings each, with one, two, or four tree genotypes represented among the host plants. These patches were divided among two common gardens. Focusing first at the level of individual trees, we assess how tree-specific genotypic identity, patch-level genetic diversity, garden-level environmental variation, and their interactions affect the structure of the herbivore community. At the level of host-plant patches, we analyze whether the joint responses of herbivore species to environmental variation and genetic diversity result in differences in species diversity among tree quartets. Strikingly, both species-specific abundances and species diversity varied substantially among host-tree genotypes, among common gardens, and among specific locations within individual gardens. In contrast, the genetic diversity of the patch left a detectable imprint on local abundances of only two herbivore taxa. In both cases, the effect of genetic diversity was inconsistent among gardens and among host-plant genotypes. While the insect community differed significantly among individual host-plant genotypes, there were no interactive effects of the number of different genotypes within the patch. Overall, additive effects of intraspecific genetic diversity of the host plant explained a similar or lower proportion (7-10\%) of variation in herbivore species diversity than did variation among common gardens. Combined with the few previous studies published to date, our study suggests that the impact of host-plant genetic diversity on the herbivore community can range from none to nonadditive, is generally low, and reaches its most pronounced impact at small spatial scales. Overall, our findings strengthen the emerging view that the impacts of genetic diversity are system, scale, and context dependent. As the next step in community genetics, we should then start asking not only whether genetic diversity matters, but under what circumstances its imprint is accentuated. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {The burgeoning field of community genetics posits that genetic variation within species affects the structure and dynamics of associated communities and ecosystems. While many experiments support this hypothesis, we argue that the most commonly employed experimental design suffers from a fundamental flaw that might result in overestimating the importance of genetic variation. Specifically, most studies collect genotypes from a wide area but perform experiments in small common gardens. Since environmental and genetic variation typically increase with spatial scale, this mismatch in scale is predicted to artificially inflate estimates of the ecological importance of genetic effects. Furthermore, most existing studies have used study systems with particular ecological characteristics, which might further inflate the inferred importance of genetic variation. To critically examine this potential problem, we reanalyze previous studies in community genetics and show how current methods lead to biased conclusions. More specifically, while a growing body of literature shows that intraspecific genetic variation can have an effect, it does not accurately estimate its effect size. As a remedy to this bias, we propose an experimental design that can accurately quantify the importance of genetic and environmental variation in affecting communities and ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Three classes of mussel, the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis and 2 genetic lineages of the indigenous Perna perna, show partially overlapping distributions along a large-scale temperature gradient in South Africa. We asked whether their physiological tolerances explain their distributional limits, investigating the effects of acute temperature change on heart rate, oxygen consumption and anaerobic end-product accumulation in air and water in the laboratory. For all 3 classes, heart rate and oxygen consumption were significantly reduced in air and were not correlated with temperature. During immersion, temperature had powerful effects on metabolic rate, but the ranking of heart rates reversed between heat and cold stress. The eastern P. perna lineage had higher heart rates with rising temperatures, while M. galloprovincialis showed higher heart rates during cooling. Despite no difference in upper thermal limits among mussel classes, their Arrhenius activation energies differed significantly, in parallel with their warm to cool distributions in the order P. perna east \textquestiondown{} P. perna west \textquestiondown{} M. galloprovincialis. The results indicate that the eastern lineage of P. perna is better adapted to warm temperatures and M. galloprovincialis is better adapted to high shore conditions. Upper thermal limits gave only a crude approximation of the effects of temperature stress. Although the thermal limits of these populations were similar, their overall responses to stress differed markedly, reflecting their distributions and potentially affecting their competitive interactions. We suggest that thermal limits offer poor explanations for species distributions, and highlight the critical importance of both sub-lethal effects and sub-specific differences in physiology.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton communities are increasingly subject to multiple stressors of natural or anthropogenic origin. The cumulative effect of these stressors, however, may vary considerably from the sum of impacts from individual stressors. Nonlinear effects, such as changes in community traits can either boost up (synergistic) or weaken (antagonistic) single stressors. Despite previous empirical studies and meta analyses on the interaction types of various multiple stressors, a more fundamental understanding of cumulative effects is lacking. To fill this gap, we here propose a new theoretical framework that is centered on the concept of interaction traits and their trade-offs. The framework is applied to a novel size-based plankton model resolving multi-species phytoplankton-nutrients-detritus-zooplankton dynamics within the upper mixed layer. The model is validated using data from a series of outdoor mesocosm experiments. In the direct aftermath of single perturbations that increase net growth rate, here nutrient enrichment and grazer removal, the simulated phytoplankton community undergoes structural changes as visible in altered community traits. These temporal variations explain why the multiple stressor interaction switches from antagonistic to synergistic as compensatory trait variations reduce over time of the experiment. This finding can be generalized within our trait-based explanatory framework to mechanistically assess and predict effects of other stressor combinations and for other organism groups.},

We augment population models with a synthesis of laboratory-based estimates of prey, predator and viral life history traits that constrain transfer efficiencies. We then apply the model framework to estimate loss rates in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE).

Daily surface measurements of six major pollutants from 54 monitoring stations of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration are used. Holiday effects are found for almost all air pollutants in all divisions and individual stations. A widespread holiday effect with consistent signs suggests a high degree of urbanization over Taiwan. Holiday effects are stronger in the west than in the east, due to urban-rural differences, and have a distinct north-south difference in the west, due to different emission sources. In the spatial distribution, as the population (motor vehicle) number in the division increases, holiday effects of NOx, CO and NMHC are intensified. Holiday effects of pollutants can also be stronger when the associated dominant anthropogenic sources in the division have larger emissions. Both imply the association of a stronger holiday effect with a higher degree of urbanization in the division. In the temporal variation, on the other hand, holiday effects and pollutant concentrations tend to weaken and reduce in almost all the urban divisions for all six pollutants except O3. These weakening trends imply possible contributions of other effects, such as the mature state of urbanization for the urban division, the effective pollution-control measures and behavioral pattern changes. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The trigger values were derived for the Australian Drinking Water Guideline and the Australian Guideline for Water Recycling as examples, but the algorithm can be adapted to any other set of guideline values. In the first step, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) describing the 50\% effect concentrations, EC50, was established using chemicals known to act according to the nonspecific mode of action of baseline toxicity. This QSAR described the effect of most of the chemicals in these guidelines satisfactorily, with the exception of antibiotics, which were more potent than predicted by the baseline toxicity QSAR. The mixture effect of 10-56 guideline chemicals mixed at various fixed concentration ratios (equipotent mixture ratios and ratios of the guideline values) was adequately described by concentration addition model of mixture toxicity. Ten water samples were then analysed and 5-64 regulated chemicals were detected (from a target list of over 200 chemicals). These detected chemicals were mixed in the ratios of concentrations detected and their mixture effect was predicted by concentration addition. Comparing the effect of these designed mixtures with the effect of the water samples, it became evident that less than 1\% of effect could be explained by known chemicals, making it imperative to derive effect-based trigger values. The effect-based water quality trigger value, EBT-EC50, was calculated from the mixture effect concentration predicted for concentration-additive mixture effects of all chemicals in a given guideline divided by the sum of the guideline concentrations for individual components, and dividing by an extrapolation factor that accounts for the number of chemicals contained in the guidelines and for model uncertainties. While this concept was established using the example of Australian recycled water, it can be easily adapted to any other set of water quality guidelines for organic micropollutants. The cytotoxicity based trigger value cannot be used in isolation, it must be applied in conjunction with effect-based trigger values targeting critical specific modes of action such as estrogenicity or photosynthesis inhibition. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main aim of this study was to assess the seasonal and spatial patterns of the zooplankton functional feeding guilds in relation to the environmental conditions. Metalimnion of the lake was detected as the most productive environment, where biomass of the phytoplankton and abundance of the zooplankton reached their maxima. Pelagial zooplankton of low abundance (25 {$\pm$} 22 ind. L -1 ) consisted of 16 species including two endemic copepods, Arctodiaptomus steindachneri (Richard, 1897) and Cyclops ochridanus (Kiefer, 1932). Copepods obtained remarkable share (60\%) in the zooplankton assemblage. Microphagous zooplankton was mainly comprised of the most abundant rotifer Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott, 1879) in summer, and copepod nauplii during the spring Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars, 1862) and C. ochridanus , and autumn C. ochridanus . Due to their requirements for the bacterio-detritus suspension, this microphagous zooplankton occupied aphotic hypolimnion during the entire study period. Raptorials were typically represented by copepodites and adult copepods in the metalimnion, and were significantly and positively affected by temperature ( r = 0.417, p = 0.001), dissolved oxygen ( r = 0.463, p = 0.0001) and, particularly, phytoplankton biomass ( r = 0.708, p {$<$} 0.00001).

They are particularly diverse in the marine plankton where some cause ``red tides'' and other harmful blooms. More than 2,000 extant species have been described, only half of which are photosynthetic. They include autotrophs, mixotrophs and grazers. They are biochemically diverse, varying in photosynthetic pigments and toxin production ability. Some are important sources of bioluminescence in the ocean. They can host intracellular symbionts or be endosymbionts themselves. Most of the photosynthetic ``zooxanthellae'' of invertebrate hosts are mutualistic dinoflagellate symbionts, including all those essential to reef-building corals. Roughly 5\% are parasitic on aquatic organisms. The fossil record, consisting of more than 2,500 species, shows a rapid radiation of cysts, starting in the Triassic, peaking in the Cretaceous, and declining throughout the Cenozoic. Marine species with a benthic, dormant cyst stage are confined to the continental shelf and fossil cysts can be used as markers of ancient coastlines. Northern and southern hemispheres contain virtually identical communities within similar latitudes, separated by a belt of circumtropical species. A few endemics are present in tropical and polar waters. Some benthic dinoflagellates are exclusively tropical, including a distinct phycophilic community, some of which are responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning. In lakes chemical and grazing effects can be important. Predatory dinoflagellates co-occur with their prey, often diatoms.},

  abstract = {Variation in life-history characteristics is evident within and across animal populations. Such variation is mediated by environmental gradients and reflects metabolic constraints or trade-offs that enhance reproductive outputs. While generalizations of life-history relationships across species provide a framework for predicting vulnerability to overexploitation, deciphering patterns of intraspecific variation may also enable recognition of peculiar features of populations that facilitate ecological resilience. This study combines age-based biological data from geographically disparate populations of bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis)\textemdash the most commercially valuable reef-associated species in the insular Indo-Pacific\textemdash to explore the magnitude and drivers of variation in life span and examine the mechanisms enabling peculiar mortality schedules. Longevity and mortality schedules were investigated across eleven locations encompassing a range of latitudes and exploitation levels. The presence of different growth types was examined using back-calculated growth histories from otoliths. Growth-type-dependent mortality (mortality rates associated with particular growth trajectories) was corroborated using population models that incorporated size-dependent competition. We found a threefold geographic variation in life span that was strongly linked to temperature, but not to anthropogenic pressure or ocean productivity. All populations consistently displayed a two-phase mortality schedule, with higher than expected natural mortality rates in earlier stages of post-settlement life. Reconstructed growth histories and population models demonstrated that variable growth types within populations can yield this peculiar biphasic mortality schedule, where fast growers enjoy early reproductive outputs at the expense of greater mortality, and benefits for slow growers derive from extended reproductive outputs over a greater number of annual cycles. This promotes population resilience because individuals can take advantage of cycles of environmental change operating at both short- and long-term scales. Our results highlight a prevailing, fundamental misperception when comparing the life histories of long-lived tropical ectotherms: the seemingly incongruent combination of extended life spans with high mortality rates was enabled by coexistence of variable growth types in a population. Thus, a demographic profile incorporating contrasting growth and mortality strategies obscures the demographic effects of harvest across space or time in N. unicornis and possibly other ectotherms with the combination of longevity and asymptotic growth.},

In strong white light, therefore, the quantum yield of photosynthesis would be lower in the upper chloroplasts, located near the illuminated surface, than that in the lower chloroplasts. Because green light can penetrate further into the leaf than red or blue light, in strong white light, any additional green light absorbed by the lower chloroplasts would increase leaf photosynthesis to a greater extent than would additional red or blue light. Based on the assessment of effects of the additional monochromatic light on leaf photosynthesis, we developed the differential quantum yield method that quantifies efficiency of any monochromatic light in white light. Application of this method to sunflower leaves clearly showed that, in moderate to strong white light, green light drove photosynthesis more effectively than red light. The green leaf should have a considerable volume of chloroplasts to accommodate the inefficient carboxylation enzyme, Rubisco, and deliver appropriate light to all the chloroplasts. By using chlorophylls that absorb green light weakly, modifying mesophyll structure and adjusting the Rubisco/chlorophyll ratio, the leaf appears to satisfy two somewhat conflicting requirements: to increase the absorptance of photosynthetically active radiation, and to drive photosynthesis efficiently in all the chloroplasts. We also discuss some serious problems that are caused by neglecting these intra-leaf profiles when estimating whole leaf electron transport rates and assessing photoinhibition by fluorescence techniques.},

Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37\% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18\%) than mid-range ( approximately 24\%) and maximum-change ( approximately 35\%) scenarios.

Current PAs may, however, continue to be important if they provide suitable locations for species to colonize at their leading-edge range boundaries, thereby enabling spread into new regions. Here, we present an empirical assessment of the role of PAs as targets for colonization during recent range expansions. Records from intensive surveys revealed that seven bird and butterfly species have colonized PAs 4.2 (median) times more frequently than expected from the availability of PAs in the landscapes colonized. Records of an additional 256 invertebrate species with less-intensive surveys supported these findings and showed that 98\% of species are disproportionately associated with PAs in newly colonized parts of their ranges. Although colonizing species favor PAs in general, species vary greatly in their reliance on PAs, reflecting differences in the dependence of individual species on particular habitats and other conditions that are available only in PAs. These findings highlight the importance of current PAs for facilitating range expansions and show that a small subset of the landscape receives a high proportion of colonizations by range-expanding species.},

As a result, many species are not able to shift their ranges in response to climate change and will likely need to adapt in situ to changing climate conditions. Consequently, a prudent strategy to maintain the ability of populations to adapt is to focus conservation efforts on areas where levels of intraspecific variation are high. By doing so, the potential for an evolutionary response to environmental change is maximized. Here, we use modeling approaches in conjunction with environmental variables to model species distributions and patterns of genetic and morphological variation in seven Ecuadorian amphibian, bird, and mammal species. We then used reserve selection software to prioritize areas for conservation based on intraspecific variation or species-level diversity. Reserves selected using species richness and complementarity showed little overlap with those based on genetic and morphological variation. Priority areas for intraspecific variation were mainly located along the slopes of the Andes and were largely concordant among species, but were not well represented in existing reserves. Our results imply that in order to maximize representation of intraspecific variation in reserves, genetic and morphological variation should be included in conservation prioritization. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here, we present a new flow cytometry method that uses up to five excitation colors to determine the relative fluorescence action spectra of phytoplankton within complex assemblages, thus leveraging the precise and high-throughput capabilities of flow cytometry and the unique combinations of photosynthetic pigments in phylogenetically related groups of phytoplankton. First, we tested the method on cultivated Synechococcus of known pigment composition and genotype then we applied the method to a natural phytoplankton assemblage where we determined the relative fluorescence action spectra of numerous distinct populations. By coupling multi-laser flow cytometry to cell sorting we demonstrated that natural phytoplankton populations with similar relative fluorescence action spectra belonged to the same taxonomic classes based on 18S rRNA gene phylogeny. This method will be instrumental in studying the ecology of distinct phytoplankton populations within complex microbial communities through spectral analysis of individual cells, identification of unique populations, and cell sorting for downstream applications such as enrichment for isolation, genome assembly, and linkage of chromatic and genetic information in a predictive fashion.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) applies mainly to fine spatial scales. New research is required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine con- ditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R2) changes when habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in local (a) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF relationship and (iii) incomplete compo- sitional turnover in species composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent},

  abstract = {Ecological stressors (i.e., environmental factors outside their normal range of variation) can mediate each other through their interactions, leading to unexpected combined effects on communities. Determining whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the linear combination of their individual effects (i.e., an additive expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative null models that base their predictions on the effects of single stressors on community properties (e.g., species richness or biomass) do not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model, which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level. Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of ecological surprises on communities based on community property null models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the responses of individual species to the community level as does our compositional null model.},

  abstract = {Cumulative ecological impacts of chronic, extreme, and often novel, anthropogenic environmental changes (i.e., stressors) often differ from the sum of their individual effects. Uncertainty over the causes of such non-additivity among multiple stressors confounds forecasts of their net ecological impact. Although stressors can interact directly within the environment to mediate their combined effects on communities, species interactions likely also play key roles. Here, we use a simulation model to explore how species interactions cause community responses (changes in species richness and total biomass) to paired stressors to differ from what we would expect based on the individual effects of each stressor (the additive effect). We demonstrate how interspecific interactions cause communities to respond non-additively to stressors, and how this depends on whether these interactions are negative or positive and whether the stressors have positive or negative impacts on the community property of interest. When pairwise species interactions involve at least one negative interaction (i.e., competition or predation), stressors combine to have greater than expected negative impacts (e.g., species or biomass loss) and less than expected positive impacts (e.g., biomass increases). In contrast, reciprocally positive interactions between species (i.e., facilitation) generally cause stressors to have additive, or slightly less than additive, net effects on species richness and community biomass. While species interactions determine the nature of the combined impact of multiple stressors (i.e., greater than or less than expected), species co-tolerance and stressor timing (i.e., sequential vs simultaneous application) only modify the magnitude of this effect. These findings highlight how interactions among species can contribute to non-additive responses by communities to environmental change, in addition to those caused by interactions among stressors themselves.},

Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea) is a brackish (12-20 g kg(-1) ) and CO2 enriched habitat, but the blue mussel Mytilus edulis dominates the benthic community. In a coupled field and laboratory study we examined the annual pCO2 variability in this habitat and the combined effects of elevated pCO2 and food availability on juvenile M. edulis growth and calcification. In the laboratory experiment, mussel growth and calcification were found to chiefly depend on food supply, with only minor impacts of pCO2 up to 3350 {$\mu$}atm. Kiel Fjord was characterized by strong seasonal pCO2 variability. During summer, maximal pCO2 values of 2500 {$\mu$}atm were observed at the surface and \textquestiondown 3000 {$\mu$}atm at the bottom. However, the field growth experiment revealed seven times higher growth and calcification rates of M. edulis at a high pCO2 inner fjord field station (mean pCO2 ca. 1000 {$\mu$}atm) in comparison to a low pCO2 outer fjord station (ca. 600 {$\mu$}atm). In addition, mussels were able to out-compete the barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus at the high pCO2 site. High mussel productivity at the inner fjord site was enabled by higher particulate organic carbon concentrations. Kiel Fjord is highly impacted by eutrophication, which causes bottom water hypoxia and consequently high seawater pCO2 . At the same time, elevated nutrient concentrations increase the energy availability for filter feeding organisms such as mussels. Thus, M. edulis can dominate over a seemingly more acidification resistant species such as A. improvisus. We conclude that benthic stages of M. edulis tolerate high ambient pCO2 when food supply is abundant and that important habitat characteristics such as species interactions and energy availability need to be considered to predict species vulnerability to ocean acidification.},

Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are composed of acid polysaccharides, and Coomassie staining particles (CSP) are proteins.

The objective of this research was to determine the role of stress and cell permeability in the formation of TEP and CSP. The diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were grown in batch cultures and exposed to hydrogen peroxide (0, 10, and 100 {$\mu$}M) as an environmental stressor. There was no correlation between TEP and CSP concentrations, indicating that they are different populations of particles rather than different chemical components of the same particles. CSP concentrations were not affected by hydrogen peroxide concentration and did not correlate with indicators of stress and cell death. In contrast, TEP concentrations in both taxa were correlated with a decrease in the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, increased activity of caspase-like enzymes, and an increase in the proportion of the population with permeable cell membranes, indicating that TEP production was associated with the process of cell death. These data show that different environmental factors and physiological processes affected the production of TEP and CSP by phytoplankton. TEP and CSP are separate populations of exopolymer particles with potentially different biogeochemical roles in the ocean.},

The obtained results were compared with those from microscopic examination. Based on the comparison, it is suggested that after increasing the ratio of characteristic pigment to chlorophyll a of diatoms and euglena, the diatoms calculated by the CHEMTAX method accounted for 80\% of the total biomass, and the results were consistent with microscopic examination, but diatoms obtained from F2, C1 and W5 sample sites were significantly overestimated 33\%\textasciitilde 60\%. The comparison also showed that the model always underestimated cyanobacteria (sample sites F2, C1 were underestimated 25\%) and euglena were overestimated (sample sites W3, Q1 were respectively overestimated 33\%, 23\%), but for chlorophytes, both overestimation and underestimation could occur. When the relevant results from previous applications in the ocean phytoplankton community evaluation were taken into consideration, it can be concluded that CHEMTAX-HPLC method was not accurate enough to characterize the phytoplankton communities in the freshwater (river/lake) ecosystem.},

To assess variability in the selected phenotypic characteristics over a wide spectrum, 10 clones were chosen for experimentation from 67 clonal isolates pre-screened for their lytic capacity in a standardized bioassay with the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. Specific growth rates ({$\mu$}) of the 10 clonal isolates ranged from 0.28 to 0.46 d-1 and were significantly different among clones. Cell content (fmol cell-1) and composition (mol\%) of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), analyzed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FD), varied widely among these isolates, with total PST quotas ranging from 20 to 89 fmol cell-1. Except for strain 3, the toxins C1/C2, neosaxitoxin (NEO), saxitoxin (STX), and gonyautoxins-1 and -4 (GTX1/GTX4), were consistently the most relatively abundant, with lesser amounts of GTX2/GTX3 evident among all isolates. Only clone 3 contained {$>$}20 mol\% of toxin B1, with C1/C2, GTX2/GTX3 and NEO in almost equimolar ratios. Eight of the 10 clones caused cell lysis of both R. salina and the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, as quantified from the dose-response curves from short-term (24 h) co-incubation bioassays. For two clones, no significant mortality even at high Alexandrium cell concentrations (ca. 104 mL-1) was observed. Allelochemical activity expressed as EC50 values, defined as the Alexandrium cell concentration causing lysis of 50\% of target cells, varied by about an order of magnitude and was significantly different among clones. No correlation was observed between growth rate und allelochemical potency (as EC50) indicating that at least under non-limiting growth conditions no obvious growth reducing costs are associated with the production of allelochemically active secondary metabolites. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although nutrition is one important factor determining resource type, the growth response of a population to resources also depends on the interaction between a species' foraging methods and the spatial distribution of the resources. For example, two resources which are nutritionally perfectly substitutable may be operationally switching, antagonistic, or complementary because of spatial heterogeneity. A graphical, equilibrium theory of resource competition allows prediction of the outcome of interactions between several consumers for the various classes of resources. The technique requires information on (1) resource type (growth isoclines), (2) resource preference, (3) resource supply processes, and (4) mortality rates for all species. For all resource types, the major criterion for stable coexistence is that each species consume relatively more of the one resource which more limits its own growth rate.},

In June, the spatial distribution of jellyfish and fish larvae, particularly those of anchovy, overlapped in the study area. Gut content analyses showed relatively high abundance of ichthyoplankton in large medusae, while siphonophores were the most numerous prey of ephyrae. Gut contents, digestion times (DT), and prey and predator abundances were used to estimate predation effects (\% of standing stock consumed time(-1)) of P. noctiluca. Medusae consumed 0.1-0.9\% h(-1) of the anchovy larvae, while ephyrae consumed 1.5-2.7\% h(-1) of all fish larvae and 1.5-10.4\% h(-1) of anchovy larvae. We estimate that medusae and ephyrae consumed 0.02-3.2\% h(-1) and 0.4-7.1\% h(-1) of fish eggs, respectively. P. noctiluca can reach extremely high numbers and in a bloom situation it can be an important predator of fish larvae, in particular anchovy. Hence it may play an important role in the planktonic food web with a possible impact on anchovy populations.},

This situation will probably demand adoption of an internal marketing philosophy within the NHS; thereby ensuring implementation of TQM and/or Customer Care schemes in which departments work together to create effective internal customer chains. To determine the degree to which the NHS have effectively adopted an internal customer orientation, a survey was undertaken using a modified version of the Parasuraman SERVQUAL model. The majority of respondents indicated the existence of Type 1, 2, 3 and 4 Gaps in the internal customer management process within their unit. Major influencers of these service gaps include departments placing internal efficiency ahead of internal customer needs elsewhere in the organization, limited effort to gain further understanding of internal customer needs and an inadequate level formal quality standards for managing internal customer relations. Respondents consider their departments are able and willing to enhance the quality of provision if the issue was given higher priority by senior management. Identified obstacles to increased future emphasis behind an internal customer philosophy include insufficient resources to service internal customer needs, lack of trust between departments and limited confidence about abilities to manage the process. Unless senior managers in the NHS can be persuaded to allocate the resources needed to create effective internal customer chains, then concern must exist about the capability of operating units to fulfil the health care standards specified in the Patients Charter. \textcopyright{} 1994.},

Due to the large amount of water that they filter daily, sponges are an important link between benthic and pelagic ecosystems. Across the Troms\o -flaket, Barents Sea, Norway, there are high biomasses of deep-water sponges. This area is also an important fishing ground, with fishing activity in some areas \textquestiondown 27000 trawl hours yr\textendash 1. Bottom trawling sus- pends large quantities of sediment into the water column, with measured concentrations up to 500 mg l-1. This is the first study on the effects of suspended sediment exposure on deep-water sponges. In a laboratory experiment, Geodia barretti (Bowerbank 1858) (Class: Demospongiae) was exposed to 5 different sediment concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100 and 500 mg l-1). Respiration rates were measured before, during and after the exposure period. The results demonstrate that G. barretti physiologically shuts down when exposed to concentrations of 100 mg l-1 (86\% reduc- tion in respiration), with thresholds of responses occurring between 10 to 50 mg l-1. However, rapid recovery to initial respiration levels directly after the exposure indicates that G. barretti can cope with a single short exposure to elevated sediment concentrations. Given the high bottom- trawling frequency in Troms\o -flaket, sponges may be frequently exposed to suspended sedi- ments. Therefore, it is important that further investigations on the effects of suspended sediments on filter feeding organisms focus on the effects of repeated and long-term suspended sediment exposures to evaluate the overall ecological impacts.

  abstract = {When describing coral shape and form the term phenotypic plasticity, i.e. environment-induced changes in morphology, is often used synonymously with intraspecific variation. Variation, however, may simply be due to genetic differentiation (polymorphism). Of the 1314 extant scleractinian coral species, less than 20 have been tested for plastic responses. Morphological plasticity has important implications for coral identification, as skeletal features used in coral systematics are directly affected by environment. Furthermore, plastic changes can indicate how corals acclimatise to environmental change. The studies that have examined phenotypic plasticity in corals experimentally can be divided into two groups, i.e. 'non-clonal' - those that have transplanted whole colonies or fragments of colonies (but not treated the fragments as clones) to new environments, and 'clonal' - those that have transplanted colony fragments and used them as clone-mates. The use of clone-mates is preferable as it facilitates the identification of among-genotype variation for plasticity. The heterogeneous nature of the reef environment makes identifying the parameters that affect coral morphology difficult in the field, but there are also many problems conducting suitable aquarium experiments. Nevertheless, evidence to date suggests light and water movement are the most important variables inducing change. As these factors are known to be axiomatic to coral growth, it is possible that associated plastic changes in corals are adaptive; however, this hypothesis is yet to be tested rigorously. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Author.},

  abstract = {Estuaries are characterized by extreme fluctuations in CO(2) levels due to bouts of CO(2) production by the resident biota that exceed its capacity of CO(2) consumption and/or the rates of gas exchange with the atmosphere and open ocean waters. Elevated partial pressures of CO(2) (P(CO(2)); i.e. environmental hypercapnia) decrease the pH of estuarine waters and, ultimately, extracellular and intracellular pH levels of estuarine organisms such as mollusks that have limited capacity for pH regulation. We analyzed proteomic changes associated with exposure to elevated P(CO(2)) in the mantle tissue of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) after 2 weeks of exposure to control ({$\sim$}39 Pa P(CO(2))) and hypercapnic ({$\sim$}357 Pa P(CO(2))) conditions using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. Exposure to high P(CO(2)) resulted in a significant proteome shift in the mantle tissue, with 12\% of proteins (54 out of 456) differentially expressed under the high P(CO(2)) compared with control conditions. Of the 54 differentially expressed proteins, we were able to identify 17. Among the identified proteins, two main functional categories were upregulated in response to hypercapnia: those associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g. several actin isoforms) and those associated with oxidative stress (e.g. superoxide dismutase and several peroxiredoxins as well as the thioredoxin-related nucleoredoxin). This indicates that exposure to high P(CO(2)) ({$\sim$}357 Pa) induces oxidative stress and suggests that the cytoskeleton is a major target of oxidative stress. We discuss how elevated CO(2) levels may cause oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) either indirectly by lowering organismal pH, which may enhance the Fenton reaction, and/or directly by CO(2) interacting with other ROS to form more free radicals. Although estuarine species are already exposed to higher and more variable levels of CO(2) than other marine species, climate change may further increase the extremes and thereby cause greater levels of oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {Environmental (acute and chronic temperature, osmotic, hypoxic and pH) stress challenges the cellular redox balance and can lead to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review provides an overview of the reactions producing and scavenging ROS in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peroxisome. It then compares these reactions with the findings of a number of studies investigating the proteomic responses of marine organisms to environmentally induced oxidative stress. These responses indicate that the thioredoxin-peroxiredoxin system is possibly more frequently recruited to scavenge H2O2 than the glutathione system. Isoforms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) are not ubiquitously induced in parallel, suggesting that SOD scavenging activity is sometimes sufficient. The glutathione system plays an important role in some organisms and probably also contributes to protecting protein thiols during environmental stress. Synthesis pathways of cysteine and selenocysteine, building blocks for glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, also play an important role in scavenging ROS during stress. The increased abundance of glutaredoxin and DyP-type peroxidase suggests a need for regulating the deglutathionylation of proteins and scavenging of peroxynitrite. Reducing equivalents for these scavenging reactions are generated by proteins of the pentose phosphate pathway and by NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, proteins representing reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport system generating NADH and ROS, including those of complex I, II and III, are frequently reduced in abundance with stress. Protein maturation in the ER likely represents another source of ROS during environmental stress, as indicated by simultaneous changes in ER chaperones and antioxidant proteins. Although there are still too few proteomic analyses of non-model organisms exposed to environmental stress for a general pattern to emerge, hyposaline and low pH stress show different responses from temperature and hypoxic stress. Furthermore, comparisons of closely related congeners differing in stress tolerance start to provide insights into biochemical processes contributing to adaptive differences, but more of these comparisons are needed to draw general conclusions. To fully take advantage of a systems approach, studies with longer time courses, including several tissues and more species comparisons are needed.},

Determining when and how the environmental context changes trait expression is of key importance for understanding the role of individual species for ecosystem functioning. The tellinid clam Macoma balthica can vary its feeding behaviour, shifting between deposit- and suspension-feeding. In order to study the context-dependency of this trophic plasticity in adult clams, we conducted an experiment assessing food uptake by using stable isotope signatures ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N). We transplanted individuals between and within two shallow bays differing in exposure (exposed-sheltered) and sediment characteristics. Our results show that isotope signatures of clams differed between the two habitats and that clams in the exposed site showed stable isotope values linked to a diet of suspended particulate organic material, while values of individuals in the sheltered site corresponded to an uptake of sediment-bound organic material. Clams transplanted between these two environmental settings were gradually showing differing isotopic signatures from clams at their original habitat, over time mirroring the changes in clams in the site to which they were transferred. The shift in carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of the clams provides insights into the context-dependent intraspecific feeding plasticity of this zoobenthic key species. The causes for this shift were coupled to contrasts in the hydrodynamic and biotic setting, implying that feeding plasticity may explain adaptation of organisms to changes in their surroundings. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

Dissolved element distributions were strongly influenced by the River discharge, with concentrations of some elements varying directly (i.e. Cd, Mo and V) or inversely (Ag, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, P and Pb) with surface salinity. Intracellular metal values to phosphorous ratios (mol: mol) for Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and V ranged from 9.0 x 10(-6) for Cd to 4.4 x 10(-2) for Fe. Although total metal composition was significantly correlated with the intracellular content in the Trichodesmium colonies for some elements (e.g., Co, Cu, V), metal pools in the phytoplankton did not co-vary with the dissolved metal concentrations, suggesting that water column measurements may not be good predictors of the intracellular metal concentrations. The impact of physical parameters and bioactive elements on biological processes such as nitrogen fixation, carbon drawdown and biomass production in Trichodesmium colonies was explored by using a principal component analysis test (PCA). The analysis indicated that the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by Trichodesmium seems to be influenced by the internal content of Fe, Co, Cd, and Cu, while nitrogen fixation seems more influenced by mixed layer depth and dissolved Fe and Ni concentrations.},

Managers must understand the effects of stressors on ecosystems in order to identify thresholds of harm but, to be meaningful, thresholds will usually need to be defined for situations where multiple stressors are operating. 2. We investigated the individual and combined effects of the principal stressors (nutrient concentration and streambed fine sediment cover) operating in native grassland streams converted to pasture in New Zealand, using two different approaches: a survey of 32 small streams and an experiment involving nine streams where the stressors were manipulated in a factorial design. We investigated the consequences for populations of benthic invertebrates and for the structure of communities, including taxon richness and the representation of species traits. 3. Up to half the taxa and most community metrics responded to at least one stressor. Our results suggest that in these streams, an increase in fine sediment loading from anthropogenic causes had more widespread effects than augmented nutrient concentrations. Of most significance is our finding, both from the survey and, in particular, the experiment, of a variety of complex interactions among the stressors. 4. Synthesis and applications. The development of indices of stream health that distinguish the effects of sediment from those of nutrients should help prioritize catchment management actions. Of more general importance is our finding that the consequences of stressors are often unpredictable on the basis of knowledge of single effects; if managers only consider the effects of individual stressors, their assessment of risk may be higher or lower than reality. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

The estimated compensation irradiance at the onset of the bloom was similar to the average for the North Atlantic Ocean, implying that shallow mixing was of critical importance for the bloom's early initiation. Planktonic POM had a much lower {$\delta$} 13 C than ice POM, suggesting that ice-algae contributed little to the pelagic biomass. The overall isotopic fractionation of pelagic N during bloom development was consistent with in situ diatom growth under saturating irradiance and limiting NO 3 - . Soon after the ice cleared, rapid physiological changes induced an order of magnitude increase in the C and NO 3 - uptake capacity of diatoms, leading to very high f ratios (NO 3 - uptake:total N uptake). Most of the NO 3 - taken up appeared in the POM, so that little net release of reduced N occurred during the period of active growth. Given the tight coupling between photosynthesis and NO 3 - uptake under N limitation, the magnitude of primary production in the Arctic Ocean is expected to respond to changes in N supply. \textcopyright{} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

We examine whether these characteristics are related to inter- and intraspecific variation in functional traits. Location: Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Twenty-six plant species (Proteaceae). Methods: We measured leaf, plant-architectural and seed traits across species geographical ranges. We then examined how species-mean traits are related to demographically derived niche characteristics of rmax, in addition to niche optima and widths in five environmental dimensions, and how intraspecific trait variation is related to niche widths. Results: Interspecific trait variation generally exceeded range-wide intraspecific trait variation. Species-mean trait values were associated with variation in rmax (R2 = 0.27) but were more strongly related to niche optima (mean R2 = 0.56). These relationships generally matched trait\textendash environment associations described in the literature. Both species-mean traits and intraspecific trait variability were strongly related to niche widths (R2 = 0.66 and 0.59, respectively). Moreover, niche widths increased with intraspecific trait variability. Overall, the different niche characteristics were associated with few, largely non-overlapping sets of traits. Main conclusions: Our study relating functional traits to Hutchinsonian niches demonstrates that key demographic properties of species relate to few traits with relatively strong effects. Our results further support the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variation increases species niche widths. Given that niche characteristics were related to distinct sets of traits, different aspects of environmental change might affect axes of trait variation independently. Trait-based studies of Hutchinsonian niches thus yield important insights into the mechanisms shaping functional biodiversity, which should reinforce the role of traits in functional biogeography.},

Urban field spider and cricket subpopulations exhibited spatial variation in their C: N ratios. Urban field spider C: N, C: P, and N: P ratios were significantly different from urban crickets, but in the laboratory population, spiders and cricket C: N, C: P, and N: P ratios did not vary. Relative to urban spiders, desert spiders had lower C: P and N: P, but C: N did not differ. In the laboratory population, spiders had higher C: N, C: P, N: P ratios than field-caught spiders. Moreover, cannibalism by laboratory-reared spiders lowered C: P and N: P ratios, but not C: N ratios. We suggest such intraspecific variation may be one mechanism that allows urban pests to thrive following HIREC. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these "supporting ecosystem processes" have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversity-ecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of "resilience attributes" useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

No direct effect of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) on viral replication cycles could be detected. FLC variability was negatively correlated to heterotrophic bacterial and net community production as well as the ambient bacterial abundance, confirming that lysogeny is a prevailing life strategy under unfavourable-for-the-hosts conditions. Further, the phytoplankton community, assessed by chlorophyll a concentration and the release of \textquestiondown 0.4 {$\mu$}m transparent exopolymeric particles, was correlated with the occurrence of lysogeny, indicating a possible link between photosynthetic processes and bacterial growth. Higher FLC was found occasionally at the highest pCO2-treated mesocosm in parallel to subtle differences in the phytoplankton community. This observation suggests that elevated pCO2 could lead to short-term alterations in lysogenic dynamics coupled to phytoplankton-derived processes. Correlation of FLIC with any environmental parameter could have been obscured by the sampling time or the synchronization of lysis to microbial processes not assessed in this experiment. Furthermore, alterations in microbial and viral assemblage composition and gene expression could be a confounding factor. Viral-induced modifications in organic matter flow affect bacterial growth and could interact with ocean acidification with unpredictable ecological consequences.},

The model was selected for its ubiquitous distribution, large size for a unicellular species, easy culture in holoxenic medium, moderate generation time, and high sensitivity to pure toxicants. The influence of different culture waters, inocula of ciliates, food, temperature, light, and darkness on the growth of the ciliate population was tested. The shortest generation time (average 39 h) was obtained for cultures incubated at 25\textdegree C in the dark with an inoculum of 4 ciliates per ml in 25 ml of Volvic mineral water containing 8 boiled wheat grains, when preincubated without ciliates for the previous week. Under these conditions, it was possible to obtain about 3000 ciliates/ml 3 weeks later. Acute toxicity tests (24-h LC50) were carried out for CuSO4, HgCl2, CdCl2, K2Cr2O7, ZnSO4, Pb(NO3)2, thiram, carbaryl, lindane, parathion, parathion methyl, paraoxon, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, and sodium pentachlorophenolate (Na-PCP). Very high sensitivity of the model to Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, thiram, and Na- PCP was established. Comparison of its sensitivity with that of Microtox (current results), Daphnia Magna, Tetrahymena pyriformis, Colpidium campylum, and murine fibroblasts (data from literature) confirms the high sensitivity of the model, especially to heavy metals. Easy-to-perform, cost-effective, and sensitive bioassays using S. teres are suitable for risk assessment and early detection of toxicity in fresh water.},

Results from 16 countries and 11 K\"oppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design.},

  abstract = {Understanding the causes of the generally positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) is a major research focus in ecology. Early analyses of BEF used a modification of the evolutionary Price equation to partition effects of biodiversity into components of complementarity (species richness) and dominance (species composition). However, early experiments and data on BEF did not use information on species traits or relative abundances. Here we extend the Price partition of the total expression of a single trait (such as leaf area) between two communities into five additive components: 1) species richness; 2) average species trait expression; 3) relative abundance; 4) the combined effects of relative abundance and trait expression; 5) absolute abundance. When applied to presence\textendash absence data with no trait variation, the method yields a result that is identical to the original Price partition into two components of complementarity and dominance. When applied to an analysis of relative abundance itself as a trait, our method quantifies the strength of species co-occurrences as a difference in Simpson diversity between the communities. We tested the new partition with artificial data sets and null model comparisons, and applied it to a long-term data set on plant succession. A key finding is that the effects of total abundance might be very important when comparing two communities, and possibly could account for results from previous studies in which complementarity emerged as an important contributor to BEF.},

Several robust patterns arise. The relationship between prey carrying capacity and temperature can range from near-independence to monotonically declining/increasing to hump-shaped. Predators persist in a U-shaped region in resource supply (=enrichment)-temperature space. Type II responses yield stable persistence in a U-shaped band inside this region, giving way to limit cycles with enrichment at all temperatures. In contrast, type III responses convey stability at intermediate temperatures and confine cycles to low and high temperatures. Warming-induced state shifts can be predicted from system trajectories crossing stability and persistence boundaries in enrichment-temperature space. Results of earlier studies with more restricted assumptions map onto this graph as special cases. Our approach thus provides a unifying framework for understanding warming effects on trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Describing how resource consumption rates depend on resource density, conventionally termed ``functional responses,'' is crucial to understanding the population dynamics of trophically interacting organisms. Yet, accurately determining the functional response for any given pair of predator and prey remains a challenge. Moreover, functional responses are potentially complex surfaces in multidimensional space, where resource density is only one of several factors determining consumption rates. We explored how three sources of error can be addressed in the design and statistical analysis of functional response experiments: ill-chosen spacing of prey densities, heteroscedastic variance in consumption rates, and non-independence of parameters of the function describing prey consumption in relation to prey density and additional environmental factors. We generated extensive, virtual data sets that simulated feeding experiments in which both prey density and environmental temperature were varied, and for which the true, deterministic functional response surface was known and realistic variance had been added. We compared eight different methods of functional response fitting, one of which stood out as best performing. We subsequently tested several conclusions from the simulation study against experimental data of zooplankton feeding on algae across a broad range of temperatures. We summarize our main findings in three best practice guidelines for the experimental estimation of functional response surfaces, of which the second is the most important: (1) space prey densities logarithmically, starting from very low densities; (2) log-transform prey consumption data prior to fitting; and (3) fit a multivariate functional response surface to all data (including all prey densities and other factors, in our case temperature) in a single step. We also observed that functional response surfaces were fitted more accurately and precisely than their component parameters. The latter occurred because parameter estimates were non-independent, which is an inevitable feature of fitting complex nonlinear functions to data: A given response surface can often be described with near-equal accuracy by multiple parameter combinations. We therefore conclude that fitted functional response models perform better at optimizing the fit of the overall response surface than at determining how component parameters, such as the attack rate or handling time, depend on environmental factors such as temperature.},

  abstract = {Animals living in groups with high conspecific densities typically decrease their level of plastic anti-predatory defence because its benefits diminish with reduced per capita predation risk (a benefit of aggregation), whereas its costs increase due to intensifying competition and increased infection risk. Furthermore, phenotypic responses that provide protection from predators are also often disadvantageous against competitors and infections. Such a trade-off may be absent when the same phenotype provides an effective defence against both predators and competitors, as is the case with some chemical defences. For such multifunctional defensive traits, both predation risk and high conspecific density are expected to increase defence expression while exposure to both predators and conspecifics may result in non-additive effects whereby the defence level induced by two enemies is lower than the sum of responses induced by either of them alone. We tested this theoretical prediction by studying the effects of multiple enemies on chemical defence in a vertebrate animal. We investigated patterns of change in toxin production of common toad Bufo bufo tadpoles following exposure to different conspecific densities and the simultaneous presence or absence of chemical cues on predation risk. We found that tadpoles significantly increased their production of bufadienolide toxins in response to high tadpole density, as well as to predation risk when tadpole density was low. Although the response in bufadienolide production to predation risk was not significant at high tadpole density, the magnitude of anti-predatory response did not differ significantly between low and high tadpole densities. These results show that toad tadpoles adjust their chemical defence to conspecific density and to predation risk simultaneously, and these two effects are more likely additive than non-additive, at least within the range of densities and predation-risk levels studied here. Nevertheless, the trend we found suggests that toxin levels induced by very high conspecific density might weaken the chemical response to predators, which is relevant for the evolutionary ecology of chemical defences, as well as for the conservation of fauna impacted by toxic invaders.

Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the 'health' of ecosystems depends.},

In the present study, the toxicity removal during wastewater treatment at seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was investigated using an effect-based approach. A battery of eight bioassays was applied comprising of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption and fish embryo toxicity assays. Human cell-based CALUX assays, transgenic larval models and the fish embryo toxicity test were particularly sensitive to WWTP effluents. The results indicate that most effects were significantly reduced or completely removed during wastewater treatment (76\textendash 100\%), while embryo toxicity, estrogenic activity and thyroid disruption were still detectable in the effluents suggesting that some harmful substances remain after treatment. The responsiveness of the bioassays was compared and the human cell-based CALUX assays showed highest responsiveness in the samples. Additionally, the fish embryo toxicity test and the transgenic larval models for endocrine disrupting effects showed high responsiveness at low sample concentrations in nearly all of the effluent samples. The results showed a similar effect pattern among all WWTPs investigated, indicating that the wastewater composition could be rather similar at different locations. There were no considerable differences in the toxicity removal efficiencies of the treatment plants and no correlation was observed with WWTP characteristics, such as process configuration or sludge age. This study demonstrated that a biotest battery comprising of multiple endpoints can serve as a powerful tool when assessing water quality or water treatment efficiency in a holistic manner. Rather than analyzing the concentrations of a few selected chemicals, bioassays can be used to complement traditional methods of monitoring in the future by assessing sum-parameter based effects, such as mixture effects, and tackling chemicals that are present at concentrations below chemical analytical detection limits.},

A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.},

We studied consistency (or, conversely, flexibility) in movement patterns at large (\textquestiondown 1000 km) to meso-scales (100-1000 km) during the non-breeding season of the long-Tailed skua Stercorarius longicaudus, a long-distance migratory Arctic seabird, using light-based geolocation. We obtained 97 annual tracks of 38 individuals and quantified similarity between routes. Overall, tracks of the same individual were generally within about 200 to 300 km of their previous year's route, and more similar than tracks of different individuals. Some flexibility was observed during migration, but individuals were faithful to their staging areas in the North Atlantic and in the Benguela Current off Namibia and South Africa. Over the course of the winter, an increasing number of individuals started to deviate-up to 5200 km-from the previous year's route. Intriguingly, individuals could be highly consistent between 2 consecutive years and flexible between other years. Site-shifts in late winter seem to reflect responses to local conditions, but what promotes this larger flexibility remains unclear and requires further study. Our results show that individual long-Tailed skuas are generally consistent in their itineraries, but can show considerable flexibility in some years. The flexibility in itineraries suggests that long-Tailed skuas are able to adjust to environmental change, but the mechanisms leading to the observed within-and between-individual variation in movement patterns are still poorly understood.},

The present paper discusses the limitations of the current risk-assessment approaches and how multiple stressors at large scales can be better evaluated in ecological risk assessments to inform the development of more efficient and preventive management policies based on adaptive management in the future. A future risk-assessment paradigm that overcomes these limitations is presented. This paradigm includes cultural and ecological protection goals, the development of ecological scenarios, the establishment of the relevant interactions among species, potential sources of stressors, their interactions and the development of cause-effect models. It is envisaged that this will be achievable through a greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines and through the application of new and emerging tools such as 'big data', ecological modelling and the incorporation of ecosystem service endpoints.},

  abstract = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown Mineral dust has a large impact on regional and global climate, depending on its particle size. Especially in the Atlantic Ocean downwind of the Sahara, the largest dust source on earth, the effects can be substantial but are poorly understood. This study focuses on seasonal and spatial variations in particle size of Saharan dust deposition across the Atlantic Ocean, using an array of submarine sediment traps moored along a transect at 12\r{} N. We show that the particle size decreases downwind with increased distance from the Saharan source, due to higher gravitational settling velocities of coarse particles in the atmosphere. Modal grain sizes vary between 4 and 33 {$\mu$}m throughout the different seasons and at five locations along the transect. This is much coarser than previously suggested and incorporated into climate models. In addition, seasonal changes are prominent, with coarser dust in summer, and finer dust in winter and spring. Such seasonal changes are caused by transport at higher altitudes and at greater wind velocities during summer than in winter. Also the latitudinal migration of the dust cloud, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, causes seasonal differences in deposition as the summer dust cloud is located more to the north, and more directly above the sampled transect. Furthermore, increased precipitation and more frequent dust storms in summer coincide with coarser dust deposition. Our findings contribute to understanding Saharan dust transport and deposition relevant for the interpretation of sedimentary records for climate reconstructions, as well as for global and regional models for improved prediction of future climate.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract = {It is virtually impossible to reliably assess water quality with target chemical analyses only. Therefore, a complementary effect-based risk assessment by bioanalyses on mixtures of bioavailable micropollutants is proposed: the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy. The goal of this strategy is to obtain more reliable information on the water quality to select optimum measures for improvement. The SIMONI strategy is 2-tiered. Tier 1 is a bioanalytical hazard identification of sites. A tier 2 ecological risk assessment is carried out only at a limited number of sites where increased hazards are detected in tier 1. Tier 2 will be customized, based on tier 1 evaluation and additional knowledge of the aquatic system. The present study focuses on the tier 1 bioanalytical hazard identification to distinguish " hot spots " of chemical pollution. First, a selection was made of relevant and cost-effective bioanalytical endpoints to cover a wide spectrum of micropollutant modes of action. Specific endpoints may indicate which classes of chemicals might cause adverse effects. Second, effect-based trigger values (EBT) were derived for these bioassays to indicate potential ecological risks. Comparison of EBT with bioassay responses should discriminate sites exhibiting different chemical hazards. Third, a model was designed to estimate the overall risks for aquatic ecosystems. The associated follow-up for risk management is a " toxicity traffic light " system: green, low hazard (no action required); orange, potential risk (further research needed); and red, high risk (mitigation measures). Thanks to cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and relevance, the SIMONI strategy has the potential to become the first bioanalytical tool to be applied in regular water quality monitoring programs.

The first tier of the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy, which was described in part I, is based on the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical measurements. Bioassay responses are compared with effect-based trigger values (EBT), and an overall SIMONI score on all bioassay data was designed to indicate environmental risks. The present study is focused on analyzing the feasibility of the hazard identification tier by evaluating results of 45 field campaigns at sites with different pollution profiles near the city of Amsterdam. A Daphnia assay was performed in situ, while silicon rubber or polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) extracts were tested with 4 nonspecific (daphnids, algae, bacteria, and cell culture) and 10 specific (9 Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene Expression [CALUX] assays and antibiotics scan) bioassays. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the relevance of 2 classification variables in the SIMONI score formula on all bioanalytical data. The model indicated increased risks for the ecosystem at surface waters in greenhouse areas and undiluted wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The choice of testing specific bioassays on either polar or nonpolar passive sampling extracts is cost-effective and still provided meaningful insights on micropollutant risks. Statistical analyses revealed that the model provides a relevant overall impact assessment based on bioassay responses. Data analyses on the chemically determined mixture toxic pressure and bioanalytical methods provided similar insights in relative risk ranking of water bodies. The SIMONI combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical testing appears to be a feasible strategy to identify chemical hazards.

Experiments at 3??C with the shallow-water morph of the quagga and the zebra mussel provided very similar results.

Starting in 2003 or 2004 with the replacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels in shallow water and expansion of quagga mussel biomass in deep water, FC began to exceed likely phytoplankton growth in the 30-50. m zone. In 2007-2008, FC greatly exceeded likely phytoplankton growth by a factor of about 5 in the 30- to 50-m depth zone, where dreissenids were extremely abundant. Low FC in the offshore region led to the hypothesis of a mid-depth carbon (C) and phosphorous (P) sink caused by mussel uptake of seston-associated C and P that affected not only the mid-depth region, but also the offshore region "downstream" of the mid-depth zone. ?? 2010.},

In mangroves, the dense aerial root network could act as a strong dispersal barrier for the morphologically diverse propagules found in these trees. In this study, we combined field and laboratory experiments to test the effect of root density, propagule morphology and hydrodynamic variables on retention rates and trajectories of the propagules of 4 common species. Overall, flume experiments showed that larger propagules were more frequently retained than smaller ones. For the larger propa gules, retention rates increased with increasing obstacle density in the landscape matrix. In elongated propagules, intraspecific variation was linked to floating orientation. Experimental wave action and increased water flow velocity reduced retention. Dispersal in the field was constrained by major tidal currents and experiments confirmed less retention of smaller propagules, which moved farther than larger ones. Overall, our results reveal that the pronounced morphological variation in mangrove propagules interacts with the landscape matrix, contributing to strong differences in dispersal capacity among species and morphotypes. These results may help to explain observed mangrove distribution patterns, including zonation at local, regional and global scales. Additionally, given that many mangrove biotopes are currently strongly threatened by human pressure and fragmentation, this information is important as an input variable for dispersal models that aim to predict dispersal patterns at multiple scales and species responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2015, www.int-res.com.},

  abstract = {Predicting the effects of multiple global change stressors on microbial communities remains a challenge because of the complex interactions among those factors. Here, we explore the combined effects of major global change stressors on nutrient acquisition traits in marine phytoplankton. Nutrient limitation constrains phytoplankton production in large parts of the present-day oceans, and is expected to increase owing to climate change, potentially favouring small phytoplankton that are better adapted to oligotrophic conditions. However, other stressors, such as elevated pCO2, rising temperatures and higher light levels, may reduce general metabolic and photosynthetic costs, allowing the reallocation of energy to the acquisition of increasingly limiting nutrients. We propose that this energy reallocation in response to major global change stressors may be more effective in large-celled phytoplankton species and, thus, could indirectly benefit large-more than small-celled phytoplankton, offsetting, at least partially, competitive disadvantages of large cells in a future ocean. Thus, considering the size-dependent responses to multiple stressors may provide a more nuanced understanding of how different microbial groups would fare in the future climate and what effects that would have on ecosystem functioning.

They have recently become the subject of headlines because of observations of dramatic declines in some places. Although there are hundreds of long-term insect monitoring programs, a global database for long-term data on insect assemblages has so far remained unavailable. In order to facilitate synthetic analyses of insect abundance changes, we compiled a database of long-term ({$\geq$}10 yr) studies of assemblages of insects (many also including arachnids) in the terrestrial and freshwater realms. We searched the scientific literature and public repositories for data on insect and arachnid monitoring using standardized protocols over a time span of 10 yr or longer, with at least two sampling events. We focused on studies that presented or allowed calculation of total community abundance or biomass. We extracted data from tables, figures, and appendices, and, for data sets that provided raw data, we standardized trapping effort over space and time when necessary. For each site, we extracted provenance details (such as country, state, and continent) as well as information on protection status, land use, and climatic details from publicly available GIS sources. In all, the database contains 1,668 plot-level time series sourced from 165 studies with samples collected between 1925 and 2018. Sixteen data sets provided here were previously unpublished. Studies were separated into those collected in the terrestrial realm (103 studies with a total of 1,053 plots) and those collected in the freshwater realm (62 studies with 615 plots). Most studies were from Europe (48\%) and North America (29\%), with 34\% of the plots located in protected areas. The median monitoring time span was 19 yr, with 12 sampling years. The number of individuals was reported in 129 studies, the total biomass was reported in 13 studies, and both abundance and biomass were reported in 23 studies.

To limit this impact, current research on biological invasions uses functional traits to facilitate a mechanistic understanding of theoretical and applied questions. Here we aimed to assess the role of functional traits in the progression of crayfish species through different stages of invasion and determine the traits associated with invasive success. A dataset of thirteen functional traits of 15 species currently occurring or available for sale in the Netherlands was evaluated. Six of these crayfish appeared invasive. Important traits distinguishing successful from unsuccessful invaders were a temperate climate in the native range, a medium to high egg count and producing more than one egg clutch per year. The most successful invaders had different functional trait combinations: Procambarus clarkii has a higher reproductive output, can migrate over longer distances and possesses a higher aggression level; Faxonius limosus is adapted to a colder climate, can reproduce parthenogetically and has broader environmental tolerances. Using a suit of functional traits to analyse invasive potential can help risk management and prevention. For example, based on our data Procambarus virginalis is predicted to become the next successful invasive crayfish in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Seasonally stratified areas in temperate shelf seas are usually characterized by a strong spring bloom, followed by limited production within the surface mixed layer as nutrients are depleted in the post-bloom period. The bottom mixed layer remains nutrient-rich, due to regeneration processes. When the thermocline is within the euphotic zone, primary production at thermocline depth is possible as organisms can access nutrients from the bottom layer. Ship-based observations indicate that production within these deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) can form a substantial part of the annual production, but this process is not captured by satellite observations. The spatial and temporal behaviour of DCM-related production is therefore less well known. To study the extent of DCM occurrence we applied a fully three dimensional, hydro-biogeochemical model to the North Sea. The simulation was used to quantify sub-surface production in space and time to determine the importance of production within the DCM layer with respect to annual and spring bloom primary production in the North Sea. The results showed that locally, in thermally stratified areas in the North Sea, up to 30\% of annual net primary production occurred below 15 m depth. In a 21-year average, sub-surface production contributed 10\% to the total annual net primary production in the entire North Sea. These values should be interpreted as lower estimates, as the model was unable to represent observed hot-spots of very high chlorophyll a concentrations at depth. The importance of DCM-related production may increase under future climate scenarios when the length of the stratified period may increase. \textcopyright{} 2012 Crown Copyright.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) is a ubiquitous selective force that may strongly impact species distribution and vegetation functioning. Plant-plant interactions could mediate the trajectory of vegetation responses to elevated [CO2], because some plants may benefit more from [CO2] elevation than others. The relative contribution of plastic (within the plant's lifetime) and genotypic (over several generations) responses to elevated [CO2] on plant performance was investigated and how these patterns are modified by plant-plant interactions was analysed. Methods Plantago asiatica seeds originating from natural CO2 springs and from ambient [CO2] sites were grown in mono stands of each one of the two origins as well as mixtures of both origins. In total, 1944 plants were grown in [CO2]-controlled walk-in climate rooms, under a [CO2] of 270, 450 and 750 ppm. A model was used for upscaling from leaf to whole-plant photosynthesis and for quantifying the influence of plastic and genotypic responses. Key Results It was shown that changes in canopy photosynthesis, specific leaf area (SLA) and stomatal conductance in response to changes in growth [CO2] were mainly determined by plastic and not by genotypic responses. We further found that plants originating from high [CO2] habitats performed better in terms of whole-plant photosynthesis, biomass and leaf area, than those from ambient [CO2] habitats at elevated [CO2] only when both genotypes competed. Similarly, plants from ambient [CO2] habitats performed better at low [CO2], also only when both genotypes competed. No difference in performance was found in mono stands. Conclusion The results indicate that natural selection under increasing [CO2] will be mainly driven by competitive interactions. This supports the notion that plant-plant interactions have an important influence on future vegetation functioning and species distribution. Furthermore, plant performance was mainly driven by plastic and not by genotypic responses to changes in atmospheric [CO2].},

To investigate realistic invasion and succession processes, not only the stable state is relevant, but also the time scales at which the system moves away from the unstable situation. We argue that the relative stability of saddle points is more important for the actual observed transient dynamics in realistic systems than the predicted asymptotic behaviour towards the stable equilibria. For the mathematical analysis this implies that not only the signs, but also the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix at the stationary points, the rates at which the system evolves, must be considered.

We describe the planktonic ciliate communities of such lakes based on a survey of 66 northwestern European lakes. Ciliates were enumerated and identified to species level according to the quantitative protargol staining technique. Ciliate biomass was on average twice as high in the turbid than in the clear-water lakes. The ciliate communities were dominated by oligotrichs and protostomatids, and no differences in functional composition or {$\alpha$}-diversity could be detected between turbid and clear-water lakes, although {$\beta$}-diversity tended to be higher in the latter. At the species level, however, community structure strongly differed between turbid and clear-water lakes, and several indicator species could be identified for the different lake categories. Variation partitioning showed that nutrient status did not explain ciliate community structure independent of the alternative states, while lake area was identified as an additional structuring factor for the ciliate communities. These results stress the importance of the ecosystem structure in shaping ciliate communities in temperate shallow lakes and suggest that nutrient status has little direct effect on ciliate community structure in such lakes.},

  abstract = {Community biomass is often less variable than the biomasses of populations within the community, yet attempts to implicate compensatory dynamics between populations as a cause of this relationship often fail. In part, this may be due to the lack of appropriate metrics for variability, but there is also great potential for large-scale processes such as seasonality or longer-term environmental change to obscure important dynamics at other temporal scales. In this study, we apply a scale-resolving method to long-term plankton data, to identify the specific temporal scales at which community-level variability is influenced by synchrony or compensatory dynamics at the population level. We show that variability at both the population and community level is influenced strongly by a few distinct temporal scales: in phytoplankton, ciliate, rotifer, and crustacean communities, synchronous dynamics are predominant at most temporal scales. However, in phytoplankton and crustacean communities, compensatory dynamics occur at a sub-annual scale (and at the annual scale in crustaceans) leading to substantial reductions in community-level variability. Aggregate measures of population and community variability do not detect compensatory dynamics in these communities; thus, resolving their scale dependence unmasks dynamics that are important for community stability in this system. The methods and results presented herein will ultimately lead to a better understanding of how stability is achieved in communities.},

The introduction of DNA -cell-cycle analysis made easily assessable by flow cytometry has been of great importance, allowing in situ measurement of species specific growth rates. Key questions in ecology such as factors determining the wax and wane of phytoplankton bloom can now be better answered in terms of species specific growth and mortality. Finally, flow cytometry provides detailed information of the physiological status of the individual algal cells. New staining methods enable us to distinguish between viable and non-viable cells and so will help us to elucidate the importance of "automortality" in aquatic ecosystems.},

Results showed that extreme salinities induced mortality in both species, while all clams survived under low pH (7.3). Both species mobilized glycogen as a source of energy towards cells protection mechanisms under extreme salinities. The native species presented higher lipid peroxidation levels while the introduced species was able to prevent oxidative damages through the induction of antioxidant enzymes at most extreme salinities. R. philippinarum also induced CA activity to balance the ion homeostasis at extreme salinities. In contrast, low pH induced oxidative damages, an increase of antioxidant (catalase), detoxification (glutathione S-transferases) and osmoregulation (carbonic anhydrase) mechanisms in R. philippinarum compared to the native clams. Overall, salinity and pH changes can alter physiological and biochemical status of native and introduced clam species.},

Here, we draw on a wide range of studies in ecology and evolution to examine the theoretical underpinnings of these hypotheses, review relevant empirical literature, and outline an agenda for future research. The plausibility of species diversity-genetic diversity relationships is supported by a variety of theoretical and empirical studies, and several recent studies provide direct, though preliminary support. Focusing on potential connections between species diversity and genetic diversity complements other approaches to synthesis at the ecology-evolution interface, and should contribute to conceptual unification of biodiversity research at the levels of genes and species.},

Here I use models of competition among genotypes and species to demonstrate a strong positive effect of the number of genotypes per species on species diversity across a range of conditions. Genetic diversity allows species to respond to selection imposed by competition, resulting in both functional convergence and divergence among species depending on their initial niche positions. This ability to respond to selection promotes species coexistence and contributes to a reduction in variation in species composition among communities. These models suggest that when ever individual fitness depends on the degree of functional similarity between a focal individual and its competitors, genetic diversity should promote species coexistence; this prediction is consistent with the few relevant empirical data collected to date. The results point to the importance of considering the genetic origin and diversity of material used in ecological experiments and in restoration efforts, in addition to highlighting potentially important community consequences of the loss of genetic diversity in natural populations.},

A sensitive genotype with a small phenotypic variation would be more prone to be lost-a critically sensitive genotype. Furthermore, natural populations inhabiting contaminated sites are usually exposed to several pollutants. Such co- or sequential exposure can have severe effects if at least some tolerant clonal lineages surviving one contaminant are sensitive to the others. Such an inverse relationship coupled with a low within-genotype variation potentially enhances genetic erosion. Accordingly, this study evaluated co-tolerance and the occurrence of clonal lineages critically sensitive to 48-hours lethal exposures of copper, zinc, cobalt, and chromium among eight clonal lineages of the cladocerans Daphnia longispina. Median lethal concentrations (LC50 ) of each metal were found to have the potential to provoke genetic erosion. Pairwise comparisons of LC50 , from the eight clonal lineages, revealed neither negative nor positive correlations (r \^o |0.56|; p \^o 0.18), but inversely sensitive clonal lineages were found for all pairs of metals. Therefore, besides having the potential to eliminate critically sensitive clonal lineages in a first intermediately lethal pulse, all tested metals may provoke further losses of clonal lineages in an already genetically eroded population.},

The ecological and evolutionary relevance of this nuclear dimorphism have never been well formalized, which is surprising given the long history of using ciliates such as Tetrahymena and Paramecium as model organisms. We present a novel, alternative explanation for ciliate nuclear dimorphism which, we argue, should be considered an instrument of phenotypic plasticity by somatic selection on the level of the ciliate clone, as if it were a diffuse multicellular organism. This viewpoint helps to put some enigmatic aspects of ciliate biology into perspective and presents the diversity of ciliates as a large natural experiment that we can exploit to study phenotypic plasticity and organismality.},

The elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS) levels observed in gills and digestive gland under exposure to Hg, individually and combined with temperature, as also long-term temperature stress have been assigned to the oxidative damage resulting in lipid peroxidation (LPX). Increased activities of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) both in gills and digestive glands under long-term exposures to temperatures are more prominent to heat rather than cold stress suggesting activation of physiological mechanism to scavenge the ROS produced during heat stress. Also decreased values of reduced glutathione (GSH) on long exposures to temperature stress indicate utilisation of this antioxidant, either to scavenge oxiradicals or act in combination with other enzymes, was more than its production capacity under heat stress. The results suggest that temperature variation does alter the active oxygen metabolism by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities, which can be used as biomarker to detect sublethal effects of pollution. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here we aim to characterize the spatial variability of major plant functional traits along wide environmental gradients in Mediterranean and temperate forests, and assess to what extent this variability differs between two dominant families in Northern Hemisphere forests: Fagaceae and Pinaceae. Location: Catalonia (north-east Iberian Peninsula). Methods: Four functional traits were selected to incorporate information on both the leaf and the wood economic spectra: maximum tree height (Hmax), wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content of leaves (Nmass). We quantified the variance distribution of each functional trait across three nested ecological scales: population, species and family. Through such scales, we explored the spatial variation of functional traits through climatic and biotic gradients, as well as the covariation among traits. Results: Functional trait variability was distributed across all the ecological scales considered, but mostly at the family level, with functional traits differing markedly between Fagaceae and Pinaceae. Within families, variation in functional traits was similar or higher within species than between species. The spatial variability in functional traits was related to biotic and abiotic gradients, although this effect was quantitatively small compared with differences between families. Covariation among functional traits was not necessarily conserved across ecological scales. Trait covariation across all species was structured along the Hmax-WD and LMA-Nmass axes, but this structure was partially lost within families, where variation was mostly structured along the Hmax-LMA and WD-Nmass axes. Main conclusions: Intraspecific variation emerges as a fundamental component of functional trait structure along wide environmental gradients. Understanding the sources of intraspecific variation, as well as how it contributes to community assembly and ecosystem functioning, thus becomes a primary research question. \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Until now such compilations have been available only for particular taxa, biomes and/or regions (Cronk and Fuller 2001; Weber 2003; Weidema 2000). In Europe, species accounts for selected invasive species have been published for a few countries or regions: the Czech Republic (Ml\'ikovsk\'y and St\'yblo 2006), France (Pascal et al. 2006), Italy (Andreotti et al. 2001; Scalera 2001), Spain (Capdevila-Arg\"uelles and Zilletti 2006); the Mediterranean Sea (CIESM 2007), and the North European and Baltic region (Gollasch et al. 1999; NOBANIS 2007). These accounts highlight invasive alien species which cause significant harm to biological diversity, socio-economic values and human health in these regions. The main purpose of these accounts is to provide guidance to environmental managers and raise public awareness of the biological, ecological and socio-economic impacts of the most harmful invaders, together with a description of the main management options to prevent their spread and reduce their impacts. The importance of the role of such tools has been clearly shown by the IUCN's 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species list (Love et al. 2000) which has been very influential in raising awareness and supporting the development of policy conservation instruments relevant to biological invasions (Shine et al. 2000). The European Environmental Agency has produced, within the SEBI 2010 project, a list of the worst invasive alien species threatening biological diversity in Europe (EEA 2007). This list contributes to the general indicator of changes in biological diversity caused by invasive alien species. The SEBI 2010 list is primarily a means to communicate the issue of invasive species to policymakers, stakeholders and the general public. The selection of the 168 species on the list was carried out in an open consultative process with an expert group, the scientific community and national environmental authorities. The main criterion used for selection was that the species have a serious impact on biological diversity at the regional level. Serious impact implies that the species has severe effects on ecosystem structure and function, it can replace native species throughout a significant proportion of its range, it can hybridise with native species or threaten biodiversity. In addition, the species can have negative consequences for human activities, health and/or economic interests.},

In contrast, negative species co-tolerance is expected to result in additional stressors having pronounced additive or synergistic impacts on biologically impoverished functional groups, which we term stress-induced community sensitivity.

We investigate the effect of temperature on coupled consumer-resource dynamics, focusing on the potential for changes in the consumer TPC to alter extinction risk. Coupling consumer and resource dynamics generally reduces the potential for resource decline to exacerbate the effects of warming via changes to the TPC due to a reduction in top-down control when consumers near the limits of their thermal performance curve. However, if resources are more sensitive to warming, consumer TPCs can be reshaped by declining resources, leading to increased extinction risk. Our work elucidates the role of top-down and bottom-up regulation in determining the extent to which changes in resource density alter consumer TPCs.},

Despite its long history, the validity of this phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis has rarely been examined. Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a significant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species. Our results support phylogenetic relatedness as a useful predictor of the outcomes of competitive interactions in ecological communities.},

In this paper, we give an overview of studies that report on the results of this remedy. Generally, artificial mixing causes an increase in the oxygen content of the water, an increase in the temperature in the deep layers but a decrease in the upper layers, while the standing crop of phytoplankton (i.e. the chlorophyll content per m2) often increases partly due to an increase in nutrients entrained from the hypolimnion or resuspended from the sediments. A change in composition from cyanobacterial dominance to green algae and diatoms can be observed if the imposed mixing is strong enough to keep the cyanobacteria entrained in the turbulent flow, the mixing is deep enough to limit light availability and the mixing devices are well distributed horizontally over the lake. Both models and experimental studies show that if phytoplankton is entrained in the turbulent flow and redistributed vertically over the entire depth, green algae and diatoms win the competition over (colonial) cyanobacteria due to a higher growth rate and reduced sedimentation losses. The advantage of buoyant cyanobacteria to float up to the illuminated upper layers is eradicated in a well-mixed system.},

Flow cytometry exhibits three unique technical properties of high potential to study the microbiology of aquatic systems: (i) its tremendous velocity to obtain and process data; (ii) the sorting capacity of some cytometers, which allows the transfer of specific populations or even single cells to a determined location, thus allowing further physical, chemical, biological or molecular analysis; and (iii) high- speed multiparametric data acquisition and multivariate data analysis. Flow cytometry is now commonly used in aquatic microbiology, although the application of cell sorting to microbial ecology and quantification of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and viruses is still under development. The recent development of laser scanning cytometry also provides a new way to further analyse sorted cells or cells recovered on filter membranes or slides. The main infrastructure limitations of flow cytometry are: cost, need for skilled and well-trained operators, and adequate refrigeration systems for high-powered lasers and cell sorters. The selection and obtaining of the optimal fluorochromes, control microorganisms and validations for a specific application may sometimes be difficult to accomplish.

Evidence is lacking on the relative importance of these two components, particularly in response to both short- and long-term environmental disturbance. We hypothesized that such short- and long-term perturbations would induce changes in community functional structure primarily via ITV and turnover, respectively. To test this we applied an experimental design across long-term mown and abandoned meadows, with each plot containing a further level of short-term management treatments: mowing, grazing and abandonment. Within each plot, species composition and trait values [height, shoot biomass, and specific leaf area (SLA)] were recorded on up to five individuals per species. Positive covariations between the contribution of species turnover and ITV occurred for height and shoot biomass in response to both short- and long-term management, indicating that species turnover and intraspecific adjustments selected for similar trait values. Positive covariations also occurred for SLA, but only in response to long-term management. The contributions of turnover and ITV changed depending on both the trait and management trajectory. As expected, communities responded to short-term disturbances mostly through changes in intraspecific trait variability, particularly for height and biomass. Interestingly, for SLA they responded to long-term disturbances by both species turnover and intraspecific adjustments. These findings highlight the importance of both ITV and species turnover in adjusting grassland functional trait response to environmental perturbation, and show that the response is trait specific and affected by disturbance regime history. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, no studies have so far been conducted on possible long-term (.100 years) impacts on tree growth caused by differences in the ecological continuity of forest stands. In the present study we analysed the variation in tree-ring width of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) trees (mean age 115-136 years) due to different land-use histories (continuously existing forests, afforestations both on arable land and on heathland). We also analysed the relation of growth patterns to soil nutrient stores and to climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation). Tree rings formed between 1896 and 2005 were widest in trees afforested on arable land. This can be attributed to higher nitrogen and phosphorous availability and indicates that former fertilisation may continue to affect the nutritional status of forest soils for more than one century after those activities have ceased. Moreover, these trees responded more strongly to environmental changes - as shown by a higher mean sensitivity of the tree-ring widths - than trees of continuously existing forests. However, the impact of climatic parameters on the variability in tree-ring width was generally small, but trees on former arable land showed the highest susceptibility to annually changing climatic conditions. We assume that incompletely developed humus horizons as well as differences in the edaphon are responsible for the more sensitive response of oak trees of recent forests (former arable land and former heathland) to variation in environmental conditions. We conclude that forests characterised by a long ecological continuity may be better adapted to global change than recent forest ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2014 von Oheimb et al.}

Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65\% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

The ARC holds that three key mechanisms govern population, community and ecosystem trajectories. Stress tolerance is the main mechanism determining responses to increasing stressor intensity, whereas dispersal and biotic interactions predominantly govern responses to the release from stressors. The shifting importance of these mechanisms creates asymmetries between the ecological trajectories that follow increasing and decreasing stressor intensities. This recognition helps to understand multiple stressor impacts and to predict which measures will restore communities that are resistant to restoration.},

  abstract = {Overexploitation of natural resources is often viewed as a problem characteristic of only the human species. However, any species could evolve a capacity to overexploit its essential resources through natural selection and competition, even to the point of resource collapse. Here, we describe the processes that potentially lead to overexploitation and synthesize what is known about overexploitation limiters in other species. We propose that there are five pathways that counteract the evolutionary drive towards overexploitation and/or mitigate its consequences: top\textendash down trophic control, interference, cost-efficiency tradeoffs, resource trait evolution, and spatial heterogeneity. These mechanisms constrain the number of exploiters and/or lower the rate of the resource usage at the individual level. We hypothesize that in ecosystems with reasonable functional diversity, coevolution strengthens this limiter network, preventing overexploitation, and thus argue that diversity begets stability via evolution. Violent population cycles in species-poor northern ecosystems and eruptions of invading alien species are exceptions that confirm this rule, because these ecosystems either lack functional diversity or there has not been enough time for coevolution to play out its stabilizing role. We propose that the overexploitation by our own species could be prevented via a network of socio-economical limiters that act in an analogous way.},

The independent effects of these ecological stressors are well studied, however, we lack understanding of their cumulative effects, which may be additive, antagonistic or synergistic. For example, the impacts of biological invasions are often determined by environmental context, which suggests that the effects of invasive species may vary with other stressors such as pollution or climate change. This study examined the effects of an invasive seaweed (Sargassum muticum) on the structure and functioning of a synthetic macroalgal assemblage and tested explicitly whether these effects varied with nutrient enrichment and ocean warming. Overall, the presence of S. muticum increased assemblage productivity rates and warming altered algal assemblage structure, which was characterised by a decrease in kelp and an increase in ephemeral green algae. The effects of S. muticum on total algal biomass accumulation, however, varied with nutrient enrichment and warming, producing antagonistic cumulative effects on total algal biomass accumulation. These findings show that the nature of stressor interactions may vary with stressor intensity and among response variables, which leads to less predictable consequences for the structure and functioning of communities.},

Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model.

Exposure to light at the absorbance maximum of the yellow product (the thionitrobenzoate ion) at 410 nm had no effect on the reaction. The light-sensitive species is apparently the DTNB, because a spectral-irradiation experiment showed that the wavelength of light that produced the maximum rate of absorbance change coincided with the peak absorbance of DTNB, and it was well separated from the thionitrobenzoate absorbance peak. Ascorbate is ineffective as a stabilizer and can produce an apparent increase in the rate of DTNB destruction. In a practical example we found the light interference to be severe when hydrolysis of propionylthiocholine by plasma cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) was measured after a 20-min incubation. The apparent cholinesterase activity in clear glass or plastic tubes exposed to diffuse daylight could be decreased to 25\% of the value obtained for samples in light-excluded tubes. We recommend the reaction be carried out in artificial room light, with total elimination of daylight, because window glass does not sufficiently attenuate 325-nm wavelength irradiation.},

We compared responses to predator cues in Daphnia ambigua from lakes where alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) either do (anadromous) or do not (landlocked) migrate between marine and freshwater. In 'anadromous' lakes, Daphnia are abundant each spring but eliminated by alewives in summer, whereas Daphnia are constantly under the threat of predation in 'landlocked' lakes. Daphnia from 'anadromous' lakes grew faster, matured earlier and larger, produced more offspring and invested more in sex than Daphnia from landlocked lakes. We observed several significant lake type-by-predator treatment interactions. These interactions, whereby the differences between lakes were greater in predator-conditioned water, agree with theory and argue that Daphnia plasticity has been influenced by variation in alewives. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.

Spiders of the orb weaver genus Argiope add linear, cruciate or circular silk structures to their orb webs, creating inter- and intra-specific polymorphic visual signals. Different decoration patterns are frequently attributed to different signal effects, but this view is contradicted by commonly observed intraspecific variation in decorating behaviour. Adults of Argiope mascordi are bimodal web decorators, building two distinct patterns, circular and cruciate silk structures. We investigated the variation of patterns under controlled, invariant laboratory conditions. Circular decorations were most frequent, but individuals often switch to the other pattern. This variation neither increased nor decreased over time, suggesting that pattern variability is primarily intrinsic rather than an exclusive response to environmental changes. Accordingly, we discuss the evolutionary implications in the light of the conservation of a single signal function through maintaining the variation of its quality and the alternative view that silk decorations may not represent adaptive signals at all.},

If populations vary in their environmental sensitivity to marginal temperatures across a species' geographical range, populations that respond better to future environmental extremes are likely to be critical for maintaining ecological resilience of the species. Using seeds from two to six populations for each of nine species of Mediterranean plants, we characterized patterns of among-population variation in environmental sensitivity by quantifying genotype-by-environment interactions (G \texttimes{} E) for germination success at temperature extremes, and under two light regimes representing conditions below and above the soil surface. For eight of nine species tested at hot and cold marginal temperatures, we observed substantial among-population variation in environmental sensitivity for germination success, and this often depended on the light treatment. Importantly, different populations often performed best at different environmental extremes. Our results demonstrate that ongoing changes in temperature regime will affect the phenology, fitness, and demography of different populations within the same species differently. We show that quantifying patterns of G \texttimes{} E for multiple populations, and understanding how such patterns arise, can test mechanisms that promote ecological resilience.},

There is, however, an urgent need to extend existing knowledge to larger spatial scales to match the scale of management and conservation. Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the stability and variability of ecosystems at multiple scales. Analogously to the partitioning of biodiversity, we propose the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma variability. Gamma variability at regional (metacommunity) scale can be partitioned into local alpha variability and spatial beta variability, either multiplicatively or additively. On average, variability decreases from local to regional scales, which creates a negative variability-area relationship. Our partitioning framework suggests that mechanisms of regional ecosystem stability can be understood by investigating the influence of ecological factors on alpha and beta variability. Diversity can provide insurance effects at the various levels of variability, thus generating alpha, beta and gamma diversity-stability relationships. As a consequence, the loss of biodiversity and habitat impairs ecosystem stability at the regional scale. Overall, our framework enables a synthetic understanding of ecosystem stability at multiple scales and has practical implications for landscape management.},

All four microbial communities (i) contained chemoautotrophs and heterotrophs, the former probably fixed CO2via various carbon fixation pathways, and the latter may degrade organic matters using nitrate and sulfate as electron acceptors, (ii) exhibited an abundance of DNA repair genes and bacterial sulfur oxidation mediated by reverse sulfate reduction, and (iii) harbored bacteria and archaea involved in anaerobic methane oxidation via intra-aerobic denitrification and reverse methanogenesis, which were found for the first time in hydrothermal areas. Furthermore, genes involved in DNA repair, reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, and ammonia metabolism were possibly affected by distance to the vent fields. These findings facilitate our understanding of the strategies of the microbial communities to adapt to the environments in deep sea areas associated with hydrothermal vents.},

We investigated genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic variation of ten populations of an introduced clonal herb Hydrocotyle vulgaris in China. Populations of H. vulgaris exhibited extremely low genetic diversity with one genotype exclusively dominant, but significantly higher epigenetic diversity. Both intra- and inter-population epigenetic variation were related to genetic variation. But there was no correlation between intra-/inter-population genetic variation and phenotypic variation. When genetic variation was controlled, intra-population epigenetic diversity was related to petiole length, specific leaf area, and leaf area variation, while inter-population epigenetic distance was correlated with leaf area differentiation. Our study provides empirical evidence that even though epigenetic variation is partly under genetic control, it could also independently play a role in shaping plant phenotypes, possibly serving as a pathway to accelerate evolution of clonal plant populations.},

Through a meta-analysis of published data from 47 sites, we developed statistical models of Dreissena impact on benthic macroinvertebrates across a broad range of habitats and environmental conditions. The introduction of Dreissena was generally associated with increased benthic macroinvertebrate density and taxonomic richness, and with decreased community evenness (of taxa excluding Dreissena). However, the strength of these effects varied with sediment particle size across sites. The effects of Dreissena differed among taxonomic and functional groups of macroinvertebrates, with positive effects on the densities of scrapers and predators, particularly leeches (Hirudinea), flatworms (Turbellaria), and mayflies (Ephemeroptera). Gastropod densities increased in the presence of Dreissena, but large-bodied snail taxa tended to decline. Dreissena was associated with declines in the densities sphaeriid clams and other large filter-feeding taxa, as well as burrowing amphipods (Diporeia spp.), but had strong positive effects on gammarid amphipods. These patterns are robust to variation in the methodology of primary studies. The effects of Dreissena are remarkably concordant with those of ecologically similar species, suggesting universality in the interactions between introduced byssally attached mussels and other macroinvertebrates.},

We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known "true" initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods. We also demonstrate that information criteria may offer significant advantages over the methods commonly used in the literature.},

  abstract = {Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

We have characterized the replication of multi-copy chromosomes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter Synechococcus 7942). In Synechococcus 7942, the replication of multi-copy chromosome is asynchronous, not only among cells but also among multi-copy chromosomes. This suggests that DNA replication is not tightly coupled to cell division in Synechococcus 7942. To address this hypothesis, we analysed the relationship between DNA replication and cell doubling at various growth phases of Synechococcus 7942 cell culture. Three distinct growth phases were characterised in Synechococcus 7942 batch culture: lag phase, exponential phase, and arithmetic (linear) phase. The chromosomal copy number was significantly higher during the lag phase than during the exponential and linear phases. Likewise, DNA replication activity was higher in the lag phase cells than in the exponential and linear phase cells, and the lag phase cells were more sensitive to nalidixic acid, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, than cells in other growth phases. To elucidate physiological differences in Synechococcus 7942 during the lag phase, we analysed the metabolome at each growth phase. In addition, we assessed the accumulation of central carbon metabolites, amino acids, and DNA precursors at each phase. The results of these analyses suggest that Synechococcus 7942 cells prepare for cell division during the lag phase by initiating intensive chromosomal DNA replication and accumulating metabolites necessary for the subsequent cell division and elongation steps that occur during the exponential growth and linear phases.},

  abstract = {A theoretical perspective on ecosystems is elaborated which relates alternative strategies of stability to observable and measurable attributes of ecosystems. Arguments are presented for viewing nutrient cycling as positive feedback. Any resultant tendency for unlimited growth is resisted by (1) finiteness of resources, (2) kinetic limitations on resource mobilization, and (3) processes of nutrient regeneration. Ecosystem structure, a static inertia defined by the mass of biotic and abiotic components, is opposed by dynamic dissipative forces related to metabolism and erosion. Balance between these two factors (structural mass and dissipative force) guarantees the asymptotic stability of ecosystems, Attention is thus focused on two aspects of relative stability: resistance and resilience. Resistance, the ability of an ecosystem to resist displacement, results from the accumulated structure of the ecosystem. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to return to a reference state once displaced, reflects dissipative forces inherent in the ecosystem. A linear ecosystem model that embodies these concepts is discussed, and four relative stability indexes are derived. Random matrices, subject to mass-conservation limitations, and hypothetical ecosystem models, constructed according to a characterization of alternative properties of nutrient cycles, are analyzed to examine relationships between the relative stability indexes and specific properties of nument cycles},

  abstract = {Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83\% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64\% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of ??-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of ??-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 ??C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46\% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38\% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The percentage of lysogenic cells induced by mitomycin C was also determined. Solar radiation and hydrogen peroxide were not as effective as mitomycin C at inducing phage production. The burst size of cells induced by mitomycin C was estimated by transmission electron microscopy, assuming that cells completely filled with viral particles were on the verge of bursting. The smallest estimates of burst size were associated with oligotrophic oceanic stations and ranged from 15 to 28 viruses produced per lytic event, while in more productive coastal waters the estimated burst sizes ranged from 33 to 64. The mitomycin C-induced phage production and burst size were used to estimate the number of lysogenic bacterial cells. On average, the percentage of inducible lysogens was higher at offshore (1.5 to 11.4 \%) than at coastal (0.8 to 2.2 \%) stations. However, with the exception of 1 station, less than 5 \% of the bacteria could be induced to produce phage, suggesting that lysogens only occasionally comprised a significant component of these bacterial communities. The proportion of lysogens that could be induced by sunlight, relative to those that could be induced by mitomycin C, was lower at oceanic than coastal stations. This implies that prophages in optically transparent offshore waters were more resistant to induction by solar radiation, or that most lysogens that could be triggered by sunlight were already induced. Based on a steady-state model, induction of lysogenic bacteria by solar radiation or hydrogen peroxide could result in between 0 and 3.5\% or 0.9 and 3.4\% of the total bacterial mortality, respectively. Our results imply that solar radiation and hydrogen peroxide induced lysogenic phage production were not an important source of phage production or bacterial mortality in offshore or coastal waters of the western Gulf of Mexico.},

Further, we conducted competition experiments with the frequently coexisting species Bromeliothrix metopoides (family Colpodidae). In contrast to B. metopoides and many other colpodean ciliates, G. bromelicola does not form resting cysts, which jeopardizes this ciliate when its small aquatic habitats dry out. Both species form bactivorous microstomes and flagellate-feeding macrostomes. However, only G. bromelicola has a low feeding threshold and is able to adapt to different protist food. The higher affinity to the local bacterial and flagellate food renders it the superior competitor relative to B. metopoides. Continuous encystment and excystment of the latter may enable stable coexistence of both species in their natural habitat. Both are tolerant to a wide range of pH (4-9). These ciliates appear to be limited to tank bromeliads because they either lack resting cysts and vectors for long distance dispersal (G. bromelicola) and/or have highly specific food requirements (primarily B. metopoides). \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s) Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology \textcopyright{} 2013 International Society of Protistologists.},

We explore the 350-year-old canon on planktonic ciliates and examine its steady progression, which has been punctuated by conceptual insights and technological breakthroughs. By reflecting on this process, we offer suggestions as to where future leaps are needed, with an emphasis on predicting outcomes of global warming. We conclude that in terms of climate change research: (i) climatic hotspots (e.g. polar oceans) require attention; (ii) simply adding ciliate measurements to zooplankton/phytoplankton-based sampling programs is inappropriate; (iii) elucidating the rare biosphere's functional ecology requires culture-independent genetic methods; (iv) evaluating genetic adaptation (microevolution) and population composition shifts is required; (v) contrasting marine and freshwaters needs attention; (vi) mixotrophy needs attention; (vii) laboratory and field studies must couple automated measurements and molecular assessment of functional gene expression; (viii) ciliate trophic diversity requires appreciation; and (ix) marrying gene expression and function, coupled with climate change scenarios is needed. In short, continued academic efforts and financial support are essential to achieve the above; these will lead to understanding how ciliates will respond to climate change, providing tools for forecasting.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45\% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the `main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity\textendash stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse `High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.},

Here, we report on advances in the study of ecological effects of viruses of microbes.

  abstract = {Large changes in oxygen availability in aquatic environments, ranging from anoxia through to hyperoxia, can lead to corresponding wide variation in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by animals with aquatic respiration. Therefore, animals living in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments have developed efficient antioxidant defenses to minimize oxidative stress and to regulate the cellular actions of ROS. Changes in oxygen levels may lead to bursts of ROS generation that can be particularly harmful. This situation is commonly experienced by aquatic animals during abrupt transitions from periods of hypoxia/anoxia back to oxygenated conditions (e.g. intertidal cycles). The strategies developed differ significantly among aquatic species and are (i) improvement of their endogenous antioxidant system under hyperoxia (that leads to increased ROS formation) or other similar ROS-related stresses, (ii) increase in antioxidant levels when displaying higher metabolic rates, (iii) presence of constitutively high levels of antioxidants, that attenuates oxidative stress derived from fluctuations in oxygen availability, or (iv) increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (and/or the levels of their mRNAs) during hypometabolic states associated with anoxia/hypoxia. This enhancement of the antioxidant system - coined over a decade ago as "preparation for oxidative stress" - controls the possible harmful effects of increased ROS formation during hypoxia/reoxygenation. The present article proposes a novel explanation for the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon that could be triggered by hypoxia-induced ROS formation. We also discuss the connections among oxygen sensing, oxidative damage and regulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense apparatus in animals adapted to many natural or man-made challenges of the aquatic environment. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

While seabirds have developed highly specialised techniques to locate prey, little is known about intraspecific variation in foraging strategies with many studies deriving information from uniform oceanic environments. Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) typically forage in continental shelf regions on small schooling prey. The present study used GPS and video data loggers to compare habitatspecific foraging strategies at two sites of contrasting oceanographic regimes (deep water near the continental shelf edge, n=23; shallow inshore embayment, n=26), in south-eastern Australia. Individuals from the continental shelf site exhibited pelagic foraging behaviours typical of gannet species, using local enhancement to locate and feed on small schooling fish; in contrast only 50\% of the individuals from the inshore site foraged offshore, displaying the typical pelagic foraging strategy. The remainder adopted a strategy of searching sand banks in shallow inshore waters in the absence of conspecifics and other predators for large, single prey items. Furthermore, of the individuals foraging inshore, 93\% were male, indicating that the inshore strategy may be sex-specific. Large inter-colony differences in Australasian gannets suggest strong plasticity in foraging behaviours, essential for adapting to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2016.

Here, we investigate intraspecific trait variation of four grassland species along with abiotic environmental variation at high spatial resolution (n = 30 samples per species trait and environmental factor per site) in two contrasting grassland habitats in Central Apennines (Italy). We test for phenotypic adaptation between habitats, intraspecific trait-environment relationships within habitats, and the extent of trait and environmental variation. We considered whole plant, clonal, leaf, and seed traits. Differences between habitats were tested using ANOVA and ANCOVA. Trait-environment relationships were assessed using multiple regression models and hierarchical variance partitioning. The extent of variation was calculated using the coefficient of variation. Significant intraspecific differences in trait attributes between the contrasting habitats indicate phenotypic adaptation to in situ environmental conditions. Within habitats, light, soil temperature, and the availability of nitrate, ammonium, magnesium and potassium were the most important factors driving intraspecific trait-environment relationships. Leaf traits and height growth show lower variability than environment being probably more regulated by plants than clonal traits which show much higher variability. We show the adaptive significance of key plant traits leading to intraspecific adaptation of strategies providing insights for conservation of extant grassland communities. We argue that protecting habitats with considerable medium- and small-scale environmental heterogeneity is important to maintain large intraspecific variability within local populations that finally can buffer against uncertainty of future climate and land use scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Investigating the causes and consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in plants is not novel, as it has long been recognized that such variation shapes biotic and abiotic interactions. While evolutionary and population biology have extensively investigated ITV, only in the last 10 years has interest in ITV surged within community and comparative ecology. SCOPE: Despite this recent interest, still lacking are thorough descriptions of ITV's extent, the spatial and temporal structure of ITV, and stronger connections between ITV and community and ecosystem properties. Our primary aim in this review is to synthesize the recent literature and ask: (1) How extensive is intraspecific variation in traits across scales, and what underlying mechanisms drive this variation? (2) How does this variation impact higher-order ecological processes (e.g. population dynamics, community assembly, invasion, ecosystem productivity)? (3) What are the consequences of ignoring ITV and how can these be mitigated? and (4) What are the most pressing research questions, and how can current practices be modified to suit our research needs? Our secondary aim is to target diverse and underrepresented traits and plant organs, including anatomy, wood, roots, hydraulics, reproduction and secondary chemistry. In addressing these aims, we showcase papers from the Special Issue. CONCLUSIONS: Plant ITV plays a key role in determining individual and population performance, species interactions, community structure and assembly, and ecosystem properties. Its extent varies widely across species, traits and environments, and it remains difficult to develop a predictive model for ITV that is broadly applicable. Systematically characterizing the sources (e.g. ontogeny, population differences) of ITV will be a vital step forward towards identifying generalities and the underlying mechanisms that shape ITV. While the use of species means to link traits to higher-order processes may be appropriate in many cases, such approaches can obscure potentially meaningful variation. We urge the reporting of individual replicates and population means in online data repositories, a greater consideration of the mechanisms that enhance and constrain ITV's extent, and studies that span sub-disciplines.},

Multidimensional plasticity, in which multiple environmental variables affect a phenotype, is especially interesting if there are interactions among these variables. We used a long-term data set from House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), a multi-brooded passerine bird, to test several predictions from life-history theory regarding the shape of optimal reaction norms for clutch size. The best-fit model for variation in clutch size included three temporal variables (the order of attempt within a season, the date of those attempts, and the age of the female). Clutch size was also sensitive to the quadratics of date and female age, both of which had negative coefficients. Finally, we found that the relationship between date and clutch size became more negative as attempt order increased. These results suggest that female sparrows have a multidimensional reaction norm for clutch size that matches predictions of life-history theory but also implicates more complexity than can be captured by any single model. Analysis of the sources of variation in reaction norm height and slope was complicated by the additional environmental dimensions. We found significant individual variation in mean clutch size in all analyses, indicating that individuals differed in the height of their clutch size reaction norm. By contrast, we found no evidence of significant individual heterogeneity in the slopes of several dimensions. We assess the possible mechanisms producing this reaction norm and discuss their implications for understanding complex plasticity. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Spring uptake rates are comparable to values at shelf sediments at similar water depths, while summer values are much higher.

Evidence suggests that personality may influence learning and memory; a finding that could improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes that produce and maintain intraspecific behavioural heterogeneity. Here, we tested whether boldness, the most studied personality trait in fish, could predict learning ability in brook trout. After quantifying boldness, fish were trained to find a hidden food patch in a maze environment. Stable landmark cues were provided to indicate the location of food and, at the conclusion of training, cues were rearranged to test for learning. There was a negative relationship between boldness and learning as shy fish were increasingly more successful at navigating the maze and locating food during training trials compared to bold fish. In the altered testing environment, only shy fish continued using cues to search for food. Overall, the learning rate of bold fish was found to be lower than that of shy fish for several metrics suggesting that personality could have widespread effects on behaviour. Because learning can increase plasticity to environmental change, these results have significant implications for fish conservation. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

With ggplot2, it's easy to: - produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification - superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales - add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression - save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse - create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots - approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{$<$} - Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system - New scales, stats and geoms added throughout - Additional practice exercises - A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() - Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

  abstract = {Spatial structure can decisively influence the way evolutionary processes unfold. To date, several methods have been used to study evolution in spatial systems, including population genetics, quantitative genetics, moment-closure approximations, and individualbased models. Here we extend the study of spatial evolutionary dynamics to eco-evolutionary models based on reaction-diffusion equations and adaptive dynamics. Specifically, we derive expressions for the strength of directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection that apply both in continuous space and to metacommunities with symmetrical dispersal between patches. For directional selection on a quantitative trait, this yields a way to integrate local directional selection across space and determine whether the trait value will increase or decrease. The robustness of this prediction is validated against quantitative genetics. For stabilizing/disruptive selection, we show that spatial heterogeneity always contributes to disruptive selection and hence always promotes evolutionary branching. The expression for directional selection is numerically very efficient and hence lends itself to simulation studies of evolutionary community assembly. We illustrate the application and utility of the expressions for this purpose with two examples of the evolution of resource utilization. Finally, we outline the domain of applicability of reaction-diffusion equations as a modeling framework and discuss their limitations.},

Using a two-resource competition model, we studied the evolution of resource-uptake specialisation as a function of resource type (substitutable to essential) and shape of the trade-off between resource uptake affinities (generalist- to specialist-favouring). In spatially homogeneous environments, evolutionarily stable coexistence of consumers is only possible for sufficiently substitutable resources and specialist-favouring trade-offs. Remarkably, these same conditions yield comparatively low diversity in heterogeneous environments, because they promote sympatric evolution of two opposite resource specialists that, together, monopolise the two resources everywhere. Consumer diversity is instead maximised for intermediate trade-offs and clearly substitutable or clearly essential resources, where evolved metacommunities are characterised by contrasting selection regimes. Taken together, our results present new insights into resource-competition-mediated evolutionarily stable diversity in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, which should be applicable to a wide range of systems.},

  abstract = {To understand how functional traits shape ecological communities it is necessary to understand both how traits across the community affect its functioning and how eco-evolutionary dynamics within the community change the traits over time. Of particular interest are so-called evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), since these are the end points of eco-evolutionary dynamics and can persist over long time scales. One theoretical framework that has successfully been used for assembling ESCs is adaptive dynamics. However, this framework cannot account for intraspecific variation-neither locally nor across structured populations. On the other hand, in moment-based approaches, intraspecific variation is accommodated, but community assembly has been neglected. This is unfortunate as some questions regarding for example local adaptation visa -vis diversification into multiple species requires both facets. In this paper we develop a general theoretical framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. We showcase how ESCs can be assembled using the framework, and illustrate various aspects of the framework using two simple models of resource competition. We believe this unifying framework could be of great use to address questions regarding the role of functional traits in communities where population structure, intraspecific variation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics are all important. 1.

MCs underpin the biogeochemical cycles of the earth's soil, oceans and the atmosphere, and perform ecosystem functions that impact plants, animals and humans. Yet our ability to predict and manage the function of these highly complex, dynamically changing communities is limited. Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we argue that addressing this challenge requires close coordination of experimental data collection and method development with mathematical model building. We discuss specific examples where model\textendash experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure. We also highlight key research questions that still demand better integration of experiments and models. We argue that such integration is needed to achieve significant progress in our understanding of MC dynamics and function, and we make specific practical suggestions as to how this could be achieved.},

The data produced have been analysed to identify seasonal patterns, inter-annual variability and long-term trends in the composition of the seven main functional phytoplankton groups. Phyto-flagellates numerically dominated accounting for on average ca. 87\% of the phytoplankton abundance while diatoms, Phaeocystis, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates and ciliates contributed 13\% of abundance. Distinct seasonal and inter-annual changes in the abundance and floristic composition of the functional groups were observed. Significant long-term changes in abundance showed that, over the study period, diatoms and Phaeocystis decreased while coccolithophorids, the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum and some heterotrophic dinoflagellate and ciliates increased in abundance. These changes highlight the importance of long-term observations for the understanding of natural temporal variability in plankton communities. Such shifts in the community composition at L4 could have important consequences for ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {The impact of temporal variation in the environment, specifically the amount of temporal autocorrelation, on population processes is of growing interest in ecology and evolutionary biology. It was recently discovered that temporal autocorrelation in the environment can significantly increase the abundance of populations that would otherwise have low, or even negative long-term growth rates (via so-called `inflationary effects'), provided that immigration from another source prevents extinction. Here we use a mathematical model to ask whether inflationary effects can also increase population persistence without immigration if different phenotypes within that population partition growth over time and buffer each other from extinction via mutation. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we find that environmental autocorrelation can inflate the abundance of phenotypes that would otherwise be excluded from the population, provided that phenotypes are sufficiently different in their use of the environment. This inflation of abundance at the phenotypic level also generates an inflation of abundance at the population level. Remarkably, intraspecific inflationary effects can increase both phenotypic and whole population abundance even if one or all phenotypes are maladapted to the environment, as long as mutations prevent phenotypic extinction during periods of poor environmental conditions. Given the prevalence of temporally autocorrelated environmental variables in nature, intraspecific inflationary effects have the potential to be of widespread importance for population persistence as well as the maintenance of intraspecific diversity. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors}

Here we show that released coral mucus efficiently traps organic matter from the water column and rapidly carries energy and nutrients to the reef lagoon sediment, which acts as a biocatalytic mineralizing filter. In the Great Barrier Reef, the dominant genus of hard corals, Acropora, exudes up to 4.8 litres of mucus per square metre of reef area per day. Between 56\% and 80\% of this mucus dissolves in the reef water, which is filtered through the lagoon sands.Here, coral mucus is degraded at a turnover rate of at least7\%per hour. Detached undissolved mucus traps suspended particles, increas- ing its initial organic carbon and nitrogen content by three orders of magnitude within 2 h. Tidal currents concentrate these mucus aggregates into the lagoon, where they rapidly settle. Coral mucus provides light energy harvested by the zooxanthel- lae and trapped particles to the heterotrophic reef community, thereby establishing a recycling loop that supports benthic life, while reducing loss of energy and nutrients from the reef ecosystem.}

Scleractinian corals function as the primary reef ecosystem engineers, constructing the framework that serves as a habitat for all other coral reef- associated organisms. However, the coral's engineering role is particularly susceptible to global climate change. Ocean warming can cause extensive mass coral bleaching, which triggers dysfunction of major engineering processes. Sub-lethal bleaching results in the reduction of both primary productivity and coral calcification. This may lead to changes in the release of organic and inorganic products, thereby altering critical biogeochemical and recycling processes in reef ecosystems. Thermal stress-induced bleaching and subsequent coral mortality, along with ocean acidification, further lead to long-term shifts in benthic community structure, changes in topographic reef complexity, and the modification of reef functioning. Such shifts may cause negative feedback loops and further modification of coral-derived inorganic and organic products. This review emphasises the critical role of scleractinian corals as reef ecosystem engineers and highlights the control of corals over key reef ecosystem goods and services, including high biodiversity, coastal protection, fishing, and tourism. Thus, climate change by impeding coral ecosystem engineers will impair the ecosystem functioning of entire reefs}

We estimate paleotemperatures for the last {$\approx$}1.1 million years of the Cretaceous ({$\approx$}66.6-65.5 million years ago, Ma) by using fossil plants from North Dakota and employ paleomagnetic stratigraphy to correlate the results to foraminiferal paleoclimatic data from four middle- and high-latitude sites. Both plants and foraminifera indicate warming near 66.0 Ma, a warming peak from {$\approx$}65.8 to 65.6 Ma, and cooling near 65.6 Ma, suggesting that these were global climate shifts. The warming peak coincides with the immigration of a thermophilic flora, maximum plant diversity, and the poleward range expansion of thermophilic foraminifera. Plant data indicate the continuation of relatively cool temperatures across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; there is no indication of a major warming immediately after the boundary as previously reported. Our temperature proxies correspond well with recent pCO2 data from paleosol carbonate, suggesting a coupling of pCO2 and temperature. To the extent that biodiversity is correlated with temperature, estimates of the severity of end-Cretaceous extinctions that are based on occurrence data from the warming peak are probably inflated, as we illustrate for North Dakota plants. However, our analysis of climate and facies considerations shows that the effects of bolide impact should be regarded as the most significant contributor to these plant extinctions.},

Viral production estimates, monitored by a dilution technique, demonstrated that new viruses were produced at rates of 10(6) and 10(7) mL(-1)h(-1) across the different mixing regimes. Using an estimated burst size of 50 viruses per lytic event, ca. 19 to 27\% of the standing stock of bacteria at the stratified stations and 46 to 137\% at the deep-mixed stations were removed by viruses.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria were the first oxygenic photosynthersizers, evolving \$3.5 bya, they have since radiated into one of the most diverse and widely distributed phyla of bacteria. Cyanobacterial diversification occurs through ecological adaptation, facilitated by asexual reproduction, homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer, and selection pressures on ecotypes leading to speciation. Delimiting cyanobacterial species is, thus, fraught with difficulties and a clear taxonomy has not yet been universally accepted. This review discusses diversity and description of cyanobacteria: covering traditional and new methods to define species boundaries and concluding with a focus on the advances made through gen-omics. Examples from the genera Raphidiopsis, Microcystis, and Prochlorococcus are used throughout. Genome plasticity allows cyanobacteria to rapidly adapt and be resilient to environmental changes, illustrating the means of their persistence, and is an important aspect of their biology. Genomics has revealed generalist and specialist genome strategies, intraspecific diversity, and genome evolution in response to environmental stimuli. New taxonomic definitions will need to account for intraspecific genetic variation, with a species classification that is relevant to a species concept and scientific endeavors. Capturing intra-specific diversity with comparative genomics may provide a new path to species classification. This is demonstrated with two case studies; comparison of available genomes shows differing species delineation of Raphidiopsis and Microcystis. In both genera, species boundaries occur at \$96\% average nucleotide identity (ANI), where homologous recombination is constrained, but speciation of Raphidiopsis raciborskii, R. brookii, and R. curvata has occurred through geographic isolation, whereas available data on Microcystis contain at least 15 species , reflecting, to differing extents, different ecotypes, which may co-exist. Both case studies question the relative importance of species-specific versus habitat specific gene pools as drivers of inter-and intraspecific diversity. Terms and definitions: Average nucleotide identity (ANI): A measure of nucleotide-level genomic similarity between the coding regions of two genomes; Core genome: The genes present in all strains of a species; CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which are the hallmark of a bacterial defense system that forms the basis for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology.; Ecotype: A distinct form of a species occupying a particular habitat; Genome strategy: Refers to the evolutionary changes of a genome, either expanding or reducing; Genotype: An individual's collection of genes; Homologous Recombination (HR): Genetic recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA.; Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT): The acquisition by an organism of genetic information by transfer (e.g. via plasmid or virus); Internal transcribed spacer (ITS): The spacer DNA situated between the small-subunit riboso-mal RNA (rRNA) and large-subunit rRNA genes in the chromosome or the corresponding transcribed region in the polycistronic rRNA precursor transcript; Interspecific distance: Distance between two species, e.g. genetic distance determined by ANI; Intraspecific Diversity: Differences between strains/individuals response to their environment within a population; Metagenome Assembled Genome (MAG): A genome derived from a metage-nome sample.; Metagenomics: The genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples; Meta-pangenome: The pangenome derived from a metagenome sample; Pangenome: the entire gene set of all strains of a species, including the genes in the core and variable genomes; Population plasticity: Variable response of populations caused by differences in strain proportions and their traits; Strain: A low-level taxonomic rank used at the intraspecific level; Variable genome: The genes not present in all strains of a species},

  abstract = {Declining ocean oxygen content driven by anthropogenic climate change has wide-ranging ramifications for marine ecosystems. These effects are significant but complex at the upper margins of expanding oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where deoxygenation and biogeochemical feedbacks to low dissolved oxygen (DO) are regulated by biological production and consumption of DO via gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR). We used `marine lakes'\textemdash bodies of seawater surrounded by land\textemdash as a natural experimental system for examining the environmental factors that dictate coupling and de-coupling between GPP and CR. Distinct gradients in DO (from fully oxygenated to anoxic conditions), temperature, light, quantity and quality of organic matter, presence of key nutrients, and microbial community structure occur across multiple stratified meromictic lakes and well-mixed holomictic marine lakes present in Palau. We found consistently high GPP rates in stratified meromictic lakes ({$>$}10 mmol O2 m-3 d-1)\textemdash especially near the chemocline, where nutrients diffuse upwards from anoxic waters\textemdash and a wider range of rates in well-mixed lakes (0.350 to 57.9 mmol O2 m-3 d-1). In contrast to GPP, CR rates were typically lower and less variable across different depths and lakes. Most depths in most lakes were therefore net autotrophic (i.e., net community production [NCP] {$>$} 0). However, experimental additions of ammonium (5 {$\mu$}M) and labile organic carbon (100 {$\mu$}M) had strong effects on CR, resulting in (i) several-fold increases in CR, (ii) larger increases in CR in meromictic lakes with chemoclines near the surface, and (iii) the occurrence of net heterotrophy and DO consumption. Our results are indicative of several biogeochemical feedback mechanisms to deoxygenation present at the upper margins of shoaling OMZs that are governed by nutrient turnover. In marine lakes, these feedbacks can have strong effects on nutrient uptake and the production and consumption of oxygen, with implications for carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycling throughout large areas of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of viral production in natural environments are critical for assessing the impacts of viral lysis on bacterial mortality and dissolved organic matter release. Here, viral production was estimated using a tangential flow diafiltration (TFD) dilution method, which reduced viral abundance to about 25\% of ambient while maintaining near ambient levels of bacterial abundance. In subsequent incubations, the rate of virus-like particle increase was measured and used to calculate viral production. TFD viral production estimates were compared to those from simultaneous incubations using a vacuum diafiltration procedure. At 4 stations in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, viral production averaged 4.8 1.7 x 10(10) and 5.9 4.4 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1) as assessed by the TFD and vacuum methods, respectively. The TFD procedure improved upon the vacuum-based method by recovering significantly more of the bacterial community and requiring less sample processing time. Optimization tests of the TFD procedure found that a 0.22 mu m pore size filter with a flushing rate of 40 ml min(-1), and a flushing volume 4-fold the initial sample volume gave the best combination of bacterial recovery, viral dilution, and processing time. Based on TFD viral production estimates, viral lysis was responsible for the loss of 14 to 93\% of the bacterial standing stock and the release of 22 to 47 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. These results indicate that viral lysis is a significant factor for microbial mortality and dissolved organic matter cycling within these estuaries.},

Thus, diel patterns of viral production (VP) in Chesapeake Bay surface waters were examined on five sampling dates. Day-to-day variations in VP in the Chesapeake and coastal California surface waters were also investigated. Significant variations in VP were detected over 24 h cycles during four of five studies, but rates did not vary significantly over the course of a few days in either location. Diel patterns of VP displayed seasonality with shorter viral assemblage turnover times and shorter times to maximum viral abundance in summer, implying shorter replication cycles for virus-host systems in warmer months. No correlation was found between VP and time of day, likely due to seasonal changes in the diel patterns of VP. This analysis significantly increases our knowledge of the short-term patterning of in situ VP, and thus viral impacts, and suggests that variations in viral biology in response to changes in host communities or physio-chemical properties affect both diel and seasonal cycles and magnitudes of VP.},

In view of this potential for harm, aerobic organisms have evolved a complex armamentorium of defenses to protect them against the possible ravages of oxyradical production. A recent growing body of evidence indicates a marked penchant for augmented oxyradical production in aquatic organisms resulting largely from anthropogenic pollutant outfalls. Two consequences of environmental contamination might be envisaged; certain compounds which cause increased oxyradical flux could exacerbate the deleterious effects of oxyradicals or the increased fluxes could affect induction of antioxidant enzymes thereby overcoming the stresses imposed by the contaminating compound(s). This review describes the various adaptational mechanisms and responses, including the toxicological consequences, associated with oxyradical production. The broad phylogenetic spectrum of examples discussed herein illustrate that while there are numerous differences among the phyla with respect to both pro- and anti-oxidant mechanisms to establish a vigorous basis of inquiry, enough striking similarities also exist to suggest the use of aquatic organisms as alternative models to mammals in various areas of oxyradical research, e.g. aging and cancer. In addition, the potential use of anti-oxidant responses, e.g. induction of specific anti-oxidant enzymes as biomarkers of environmental contamination is reviewed. ?? 1990.},

Consumer diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are highly context dependent and are determined by consumer specialization and other consumer and prey specific traits such as growth and grazing rates. Despite complex reciprocal interactions between consumers and their prey, few experimental studies have focused on prey diversity effects on consumer dynamics and trophic transfer. In microbial microcosms, we investigated effects of algal prey diversity (one, two and four species) on the production, evenness and grazing rates of 4 ciliate consumers, differing in grazing preferences and rates. Prey diversity increased prey biovolume in the absence of consumers and had opposing effects on different consumers, depending on their specialization and their preferred prey. Consumers profited from prey mixtures compared to monocultures of non-preferred prey, but responded negatively if preferred prey species were offered together with other species. Prey diversity increased consumer evenness by preventing dominance of specific consumers, demonstrating that the loss of prey species may have cascading effects resulting in reduced consumer diversity. Our study emphasizes that not only the degree of specialization but also the selectivity for certain prey species within the dietary niche may alter the consequences of changing prey diversity in a food web context.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity decline causes a loss of functional diversity, which threatens ecosystems through a dangerous feedback loop: This loss may hamper ecosystems' ability to buffer environmental changes, leading to further biodiversity losses. In this context, the increasing frequency of human-induced excessive loading of nutrients causes major problems in aquatic systems. Previous studies investigating how functional diversity influences the response of food webs to disturbances have mainly considered systems with at most two functionally diverse trophic levels. We investigated the effects of functional diversity on the robustness, that is, resistance, resilience, and elasticity, using a tritrophic\textemdash and thus more realistic\textemdash plankton food web model. We compared a non-adaptive food chain with no diversity within the individual trophic levels to a more diverse food web with three adaptive trophic levels. The species fitness differences were balanced through trade-offs between defense/growth rate for prey and selectivity/half-saturation constant for predators. We showed that the resistance, resilience, and elasticity of tritrophic food webs decreased with larger perturbation sizes and depended on the state of the system when the perturbation occurred. Importantly, we found that a more diverse food web was generally more resistant and resilient but its elasticity was context-dependent. Particularly, functional diversity reduced the probability of a regime shift toward a non-desirable alternative state. The basal-intermediate interaction consistently determined the robustness against a nutrient pulse despite the complex influence of the shape and type of the dynamical attractors. This relationship was strongly influenced by the diversity present and the third trophic level. Overall, using a food web model of realistic complexity, this study confirms the destructive potential of the positive feedback loop between biodiversity loss and robustness, by uncovering mechanisms leading to a decrease in resistance, resilience, and potentially elasticity as functional diversity declines.},

The aim of this study was to approximate the range of strain-specific reaction patterns within an Arctic diatom population, which selection can act upon. In a laboratory experiment, we first incubated natural communities from an Arctic fjord under present and future conditions. In a second step, single strains of the diatom Thalassiosira hyalina were isolated from these selection environments and exposed to a matrix of temperature (3\textdegree C and 6\textdegree C) and pCO2 levels (180 {$\mu$}atm, 370 {$\mu$}atm, 1000 {$\mu$}atm, 1400 {$\mu$}atm) to establish reaction norms for growth, production rates, and elemental quotas. The results revealed interactive effects of temperature and pCO2 as well as wide tolerance ranges. Between strains, however, sensitivities and optima differed greatly. These strain-specific responses corresponded well with their respective selection environments of the previous community incubation. We therefore hypothesize that intraspecific variability and the selection between coexisting strains may pose an underestimated source of species' plasticity. Thus, adaptation of phytoplankton assemblages may also occur by selection within rather than only between species, and species-wide inferences from single strain experiments should be treated with caution.},

The species-level structure of actinostromatid assemblages from the Devonian of southern Poland is described in the present paper, with special emphasis on ecological factors that influenced species composition of the communities. Nine species of the genera Actinostroma and Bifariostroma are distinguished. Members of the family Actinostromatidae predominated in stromatoporoid assemblages within lower Frasnian carbonate buildup margins. The most diverse actinostromatid faunas were found within the middle Givetian Stringocephalus Bank, in the upper Givetian-lower Frasnian biostromal complex and in the lower Frasnian organic buildups. Species-level biodiversity was lowest within detrital facies which surrounded the Frasnian carbonate buildups. Species of Actinostroma with well-developed colliculi are commonest within the middle Givetian to early Frasnian coral-stromatoporoid biostromal complexes, whereas species with strongly reduced colliculi predominate early-middle Frasnian organic buildups. The skeletal structure of actinostromatids reflects environmental changes, documenting a transition from species with thin, close-set pillars and widely spaced laminae (common in the middle Givetian) to those with long, thick pillars and megapillars (in Bifariostroma), which were predominant during the early and middle Frasnian. The distribution of growth forms among species reveals a significant intraspecific variation. Species of Actinostroma can be either tabular or low domical, depending on the palaeoenvironmental setting. Thus, the present study confirms that stromatoporoid morphology was influenced by environmental conditions.},

Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Species traits and environmental conditions determine the occurrence and strength of trophic interactions. If we understand the relationship between these factors and trophic interactions, we can make more accurate predictions and build better trophic-interaction models. We can compare traits and conditions by considering their effect on different parts (steps) of a trophic interaction, such as the steps search and pursuit. By linking traits to relevant steps, we can use these relationships to build trophic-interaction models. Currently, this is done ad hoc, defining steps based on the species and traits of interest. This makes it difficult to compare across traits and species and gain an overarching understanding of how traits and the environment drive trophic interactions. We present a comprehensive approach for the explicit choice of interaction steps and species traits or environmental conditions, which is readily integrated into existing models. The core of this framework is that it is modular; we present eight steps that occur in all trophic interactions and use them to build a modular, general dynamic model. When applying the framework, one explicitly selects only the most relevant steps and uses those to build a specific model. To build our modular framework, we revisit and expand the functional and numerical response functions, dividing the trophic interaction into eight steps: (1) search, (2) prey detection, (3) attack decision, (4) pursuit, (5) subjugation, (6) ingestion, (7) digestion and (8) nutrient allocation. Together these steps form a general dynamical model where trophic interactions can be explicitly parameterized for multiple traits and environmental factors. We then concretize this approach by outlining how a specific community can be modelled by selecting key modules (steps) and parameterizing them for relevant factors. This we exemplify for a community of terrestrial arthropods using empirical data on body size and temperature responses. With species interactions at the core of community dynamics, our modular approach allows for quantification and comparisons of the importance of different steps, traits, and abiotic factors across ecosystems and trophic-interaction types, and provides a powerful tool for trait-based prediction of food-web structure and dynamics.

  abstract = {The importance of intraspecific trait variability for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning has been underappreciated. There are theoretical reasons for predicting that species that differ in intraspecific trait variability will also differ in their effects on ecosystem functioning, particularly in variable environments. We discuss whether species with greater trait variability are likely to exhibit greater temporal stability in their population dynamics, and under which conditions this might lead to stability in ecosystem functioning. Resolving this requires us to consider several questions. First, are species with high levels of variation for one trait equally variable in others? In particular, is variability in response and effects traits typically correlated? Second, what is the relative contribution of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to trait variability? If local adaptation dominates, then stability in function requires one of two conditions: (i) individuals of appropriate phenotypes present in the environment at high enough frequencies to allow for populations to respond rapidly to the changing environment, and (ii) high levels of dispersal and gene flow. while we currently lack sufficient information on the causes and distribution of variability in functional traits, filling in these key data gaps should increase our ability to predict how changing biodiversity will alter ecosystem functioning. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Although abiotic factors may be important first-order filters dictating which sponge species can thrive at a particular site, ecological interactions can play substantial roles influencing distribution and abundance, and thus diversity. Ecological interactions can modify the influences of abiotic factors both by further constraining distribution and abundance due to competitive or predatory interactions and by expanding habitat distribution or abundance due to beneficial interactions that ameliorate otherwise limiting circumstances. It is likely that the importance of ecological interactions has been greatly underestimated because they tend to only be revealed by experiments and time-series observations in the field.Experiments have revealed opportunistic predation to be a primary enforcer of sponge distribution boundaries that coincide with habitat boundaries in several systems. Within habitats, by contrast, dramatic effects of predators on sponge populations seem to occur primarily in cases of unusually high recruitment rates or unusually low mortality rates for the predators, which are often specialists on the sponge species affected. Competitive interactions have been demonstrated to diminish populations or exclude sponge species from a habitat in only a few cases. Cases in which competitive interactions have appeared obvious have often turned out to be neutral or even beneficial interactions when observed over time. Especially striking in this regard are sponge-sponge interactions in dense sponge-dominated communities, which may promote the continued coexistence of all participating species. Mutualistic symbioses of sponges with other animals, plants, or macroalgae have been demonstrated to increase abundance, habitat distribution, and diversity of all participants. Symbiotic microbes can enhance sponge distribution and abundance but also render their hosts more vulnerable to environmental changes. And while photosynthetic symbionts can boost growth and excavation rates for some sponge hosts, in other cases sponge growth proceeds as well or even better in diminished light.Metrics chosen for evaluating sponge abundance make a substantial difference in interpretation of data comparing between different sites, or over time at the same site. In most cases, evaluating abundance by volume or biomass allows more ecologically meaningful interpretation of influences on distribution and abundance than does evaluating abundance by numbers of individuals or area covered. Accurate identification of species, and understanding how they are related within higher taxa, is essential. Studies in every habitat have illustrated the great power of experimental manipulations, and of time-series observations of sponge individuals, for understanding the processes underlying observed patterns; in many cases, these processes have been revealed to be ecological interactions. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus are the most abundant and widely distributed picocyanobacteria in the ocean. The salt-wedge type of estuary possesses the complete horizontal and vertical gradient of salinity together with other physical and chemical parameters. In order to reveal whether such a complex environmental gradient harbors a high diversity of Synechococcus, we investigated the abundance, taxonomic composition and pigment genetic diversity of Synechococcus in surface and bottom waters across the salinity gradient in a salt-wedge estuary by flow cytometric analysis and pyrosequencing of the rpoC1 gene and cpcBA operon (encoding phycocyanin). Synechococcus were ubiquitously distributed in the studied region, with clear spatial variations both horizontally and vertically. The abundance and diversity of Synechococcus were low in the freshwater-dominated low salinity waters. By pyrosequencing of the rpoC1 gene, we have shown that with the increase of salinity, the dominant Synechococcus shifted from the freshwater Synechococcus to the combination of phylogenetic subcluster 5.2 and freshwater Synechococcus, and then the strictly marine subcluster 5.1 clade III. Besides, the composition of Synechococcus assemblage in the deep layer was markedly different from the surface in the stratified waters (dissimilarities: 40.32\%-95.97\%, SIMPER analysis). High abundance of clade III Synechococcus found in the brackish waters may revise our previous understanding that strains of this clade prefers oligotrophic environment. Our data also suggested that both the phylogenetic subcluster 5.3 Synechococcus, a lineage that was not well understood, and subcluster 5.1 clade I, a typical cold water lineage, were widely distributed in the bottom layer of the estuary. Clade I detected in the studied region was mainly contributed by subclade IG. Analysis of the cpcBA operon sequences revealed niche partitioning between type 1 and type 3 Synechococcus, with type 2 distributed broadly across the whole environmental gradients. Our results suggest that the salt wedge estuary provides various niches for different lineages of Synechococcus, making it an environment with high Synechococcus diversity compared with adjacent freshwater and shelf sea environments.},

  abstract = {A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the coexistence of species engaging in exploitative competition. The Armstrong-McGehee mechanism relies on different levels of nonlinearity in functional response between competing consumers and their ability to avoid competitive exclusion through temporal resource partitioning during endogenously generated fluctuations. While previous studies have mainly focused on cases where one consumer has nonlinear functional response and the other consumer has linear functional response, our study assessed coexistence and competitive exclusion under a more realistic scenario with two nonlinear consumers. Using analytical and numerical methods we found that the potential of coexistence of the two consumers decreases with increasing nonlinearity in the more linear species; increasing nonlinearity in the more nonlinear species, however, resulted in non-monotonic changes in the parameter space allowing coexistence. When coexistence potential is quantified under the presupposition that each consumer must be able to persist with the resource by itself, coexistence becomes consistently less likely with increasing similarity of the functional responses of the two consumers. Our results suggest that the Armstrong-McGehee mechanism is unlikely to operate as the sole coexistence-promoting mechanism in communities with generally nonlinear consumer-resource interactions. However, its role as a module in more complex systems and in synergy with other factors remains to be established. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Coevolution is one of the major drivers of complex dynamics in population ecology. Historically, antagonistic coevolution in victim-exploiter systems has been a topic of special interest, and involves traits with various genetic architectures (e.g., the number of genes involved) and effects on interactions. For example, exploiters may need to have traits that ``match'' those of victims for successful exploitation (i.e., a matching interaction), or traits that exceed those of victims (i.e., a difference interaction). Different models exist which are appropriate for different types of traits, including Mendelian (discrete) and quantitative (continuous) traits. For models with multiple Mendelian traits, recent studies have shown that antagonistic coevolutionary patterns that appear as matching interactions can arise due to multiple difference interactions with costs of having large trait values. Here we generalize their findings to quantitative traits and show, analogously, that the multidimensional difference interactions with costs sometimes behave qualitatively the same as matching interactions. While previous studies in quantitative genetics have used the dichotomy between matching and difference frameworks to explore coevolutionary dynamics, we suggest that exploring multidimensional trait space is important to examine the generality of results obtained from one-dimensional traits.},

Here we identify a previously unrecognised mode by which rapid evolution can promote species coexistence via temporal fluctuations and a trade-off between competitive ability and the speed of adaptive evolution. We show that this interaction between rapid evolution and temporal fluctuations not only increases the range of coexistence conditions under a gleaner-opportunist trade-off (i.e. low minimum resource requirement [R*] vs. high maximum growth rate) but also yields stable coexistence in the absence of a classical gleaner-opportunist trade-off. Given the propensity for both oscillatory dynamics and different rates of adaptation between species (including rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity) in the real world, we argue that this expansion of fluctuation-dependent coexistence theory provides an important overlooked solution to the so-called `paradox of the plankton'.},

However, recent studies suggest that rapid evolution operating concurrently with competition may enable species coexistence. Such findings necessitate general theory that incorporates the coexistence contributions of eco-evolutionary processes in parallel with purely ecological mechanisms and provides metrics for quantifying the role of evolution in shaping competitive outcomes in both modelling and empirical contexts. To foster the development of such theory, here we extend the interpretation of the two principal metrics of modern coexistence theory\textemdash niche and competitive ability differences\textemdash to systems where competitors evolve. We define eco-evolutionary versions of these metrics by considering how invading and resident species adapt to conspecific and heterospecific competitors. We show that the eco-evolutionary niche and competitive ability differences are sums of ecological and evolutionary processes, and that they accurately predict the potential for stable coexistence in previous theoretical studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Finally, we show how this theory frames recent empirical assessments of rapid evolution effects on species coexistence, and how empirical work and theory on species coexistence and eco-evolutionary dynamics can be further integrated.},

The relative contribution of the viral subcluster with high fluorescence intensity (HV) increased with increasing abundance of APP. These data are consistent with the notion that viruses infecting APP are abundant, and the HV subcluster might contain large numbers of these viruses especially in subtropical and tropical oceans. Relationships between viral abundance and biotic variables differed among regions, indicating that controls of virus-host systems are largely distinct among different oceanic regions. We found a conspicuous peak of viral abundance in the mid-latitude region of the North Pacific. This `viral hot spot' coincided with a dissolved oxygen anomaly (the excess above saturation) indicated by negative values (\textendash 15 to \textendash 59 \textmu mol kg\textendash 1) of apparent oxygen utilization.

With a maximum of 800 wild animals, the species is endangered and one of the rarest Chinese primates. To assess the genetic diversity within R. brelichi and to analyze its genetic population structure, we collected fecal samples from the wild R. brelichi population and sequenced the hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial control region from 141 individuals. We compared our data with those from the two other Chinese snub-nosed species (R. roxellana, R. bieti) and reconstructed their phylogenetic relationships and divergence times. With only five haplotypes and a maximum of 25 polymorphic sites, R. brelichi shows the lowest genetic diversity in terms of haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity ({$\pi$}), and average number of pairwise nucleotide differences ({$\Pi$}). The most recent common ancestor of R. brelichi lived {$\sim$}0.36 million years ago (Ma), thus more recently than those of R. roxellana ({$\sim$}0.91 Ma) and R. bieti ({$\sim$}1.33 Ma). Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed a clear and significant differentiation among the three Chinese snub-nosed monkey species. Population genetic analyses (Tajima's D, Fu's F s , and mismatch distribution) suggest a stable population size for R. brelichi. For the other two species, results point in the same direction, but population substructure possibly introduces some ambiguity. Because of the lower genetic variation, the smaller population size and the more restricted distribution, R. brelichi might be more vulnerable to environmental changes or climate oscillations than the other two Chinese snub-nosed monkey species.

Low C18:1n-7/n-9 ratios and high C20:1 (n-11 and n-9) and C22:1 (n-11 and n-9) concentrations suggested jellyfishes in the Yellow Sea were carnivorous and zooplanktons were an important diet for them.

Specific fatty acids (C20:1 + C22:1 and C20:4n-6) indicated that both pelagic-derived material and benthic detritus-derived food were diet of jellyfishes. Variations of certain biomarkers (C15:0 + C17:0, C20:1 + C22:1 (n-11 and n-9) and C20:4n-6) in jellyfishes of different body sizes suggested that ontogenetic diet shifts may take place during the growth of jellyfishes. Larger individuals with higher C20:1 + C22:1 (n-11 and n-9) concentration, tended to consume more zooplanktons; while the detritus-derived material made a more significant contribution to the small individuals, as suggested by higher C15:0 + C17:0 and C20:4n-6 concentrations.

We then conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of disturbance on parasite prevalence, which revealed no overall effect, but a positive effect for one of four types of parasites (indirectly transmitted parasites). Finally, we conducted intraspecific analyses of malaria prevalence as a function of mammalian species richness in chimpanzees and gorillas, and an interspecific analysis of geographic overlap and parasite species richness, finding that higher levels of host richness favoured greater parasite risk.

Specific leaf area, leaf relative water content, leaf tissue density and leaf thickness differed significantly among seedlings from different provenances, implying high leaf morphological plasticity.

  abstract = {Background: Intraspecific variability is seen as a central component of biodiversity. We investigated genetic differentiation, contemporary patterns of demographic connectivity and intraspecific variation of adaptive behavioural traits in two lineages of an intertidal mussel (Perna perna) across a tropical/subtropical biogeographic transition. Results: Microsatellite analyses revealed clear genetic differentiation between western (temperate) and eastern (subtropical/tropical) populations, confirming divergence previously detected with mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (ITS) markers. Gene flow between regions was predominantly east-to-west and was only moderate, with higher heterozygote deficiency where the two lineages co-occur. This can be explained by differential selection and/or oceanographic dynamics acting as a barrier to larval dispersal. Common garden experiments showed that gaping (periodic closure and opening of the shell) and attachment to the substratum differed significantly between the two lineages. Western individuals gaped more and attached less strongly to the substratum than eastern ones. Conclusions: These behavioural differences are consistent with the geographic and intertidal distributions of each lineage along sharp environmental clines, indicating their strong adaptive significance. We highlight the functional role of diversity below the species level in evolutionary trends and the need to understand this when predicting biodiversity responses to environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2015 Zardi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

Because entire plant functional groups disappeared faster than expected by chance, resistance declined dramatically with progressive species losses.

  abstract = {Abstract Historically, evolutionary changes have been thought to act on much longer time scales than ecological dynamics. However, a recent body of research has demonstrated that evolution that is rapid enough to dramatically affect ecological dynamics can lead to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, to understand the stability of ecological communities, we must also consider evolutionary change in the component species. Here, we use individual-based simulations of a quantitative genetic eco-evolutionary model to describe how trait evolution influences the stability of ecological communities. On short time scales, faster evolutionary rates decreased the probability of species extinctions as populations at low densities were rescued via trait evolution. However, on longer time scales, evolutionary had little effect on the number of extinctions. The extent of short-term evolutionary rescue depended on the source of trait variation; populations with variation generated through mutation experienced more rescue events and were less prone to extinction, relative to populations with only standing trait variation. Trait evolution leading to more rescued populations increased the stability of the community on timescales relevant to conservation. Our work highlights the importance of intraspecific trait variation and the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining this variation for community ecology, as well as management of declining populations in a community context.},

Common carp Cyprinus carpio were raised in three temperature treatments [the 18 \textdegree C, 28 \textdegree C and 28 \textdegree C-food control (28 \textdegree C-FC)] and fed to satiation of receiving food either once or twice daily for 4 weeks. The morphology and metabolic rates (standard metabolic rate, SMR; maximum metabolic rate, MMR) were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. The mean total food ingested by fish in the 28 \textdegree C-FC treatment was the same as that by fish in the 18 \textdegree C treatment at each food availability. The final SMR (not MMR and aerobic scope, AS = MMR - SMR) increased more in the 28 \textdegree C and 28 \textdegree C-FC treatments with twice-daily feedings than once-daily feedings. Fish in the 28 \textdegree C treatment had a higher specific growth rate (SGR) than fish in the 28 \textdegree C-FC and 18 \textdegree C treatments at both food availabilities. However, no differences in feeding efficiency (FE) were found among the three treatments in fish fed twice daily. The flexibility in SMR was related to individual differences in SGR, not with food intake and FE; individuals who increased their SMR more had a smaller growth performance with twice-daily feedings at 28 \textdegree C, but it did not exist at 18 \textdegree C. Flexibility in SMR provides a growth advantage in juvenile common carp experiencing changes in food availability and this link is temperature-dependent. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Inc.}

On the basis of a systematic review, we show that interactions with positive fitness effects for individuals of a clade (e.g. insect pollination for plants) generally increase that clade's diversification rates. Conversely, we find that interactions with negative fitness effects (e.g. predation for prey, competition) generally decrease diversification rates. The sampled clades incorporate all animals and land plants, encompassing 90\% of all described species across life. Overall, we show that different types of local-scale species interactions can predictably impact large-scale patterns of diversification and richness.},

Mucus is involved in particle removal and feeding processes, yet the triggers and dynamics of mucus production are currently still poorly described because the existing tools to study these processes are not appropriate. Using a novel microscopic technique-digital holographic microscopy (DHM)-we studied the mucus release of L. pertusa under various experimental conditions. DHM technology permits {$\mu$}m-scale observations and allows the visualization of transparent mucoid substances in real time without staining. Fragments of L. pertusa were first maintained in flow-through chambers without stressors and imaged with DHM, then exposed to various stressors (suspended particles, particulate food and air exposure) and re-imaged. Under non-stressed conditions no release of mucus was observed, whilst mucus strings and sheaths were produced in response to suspended particles (activated charcoal and drill cuttings sediment) i.e. in a stressed condition. Mucus strings and so-called 'string balls' were also observed in response to exposure to particulate food (brine shrimp Artemia salina). Upon air-exposure, mucus production was clearly visible once the fragments were returned to the flow chamber. Distinct optical properties such as optical path length difference (OPD) were measured with DHM in response to the various stimuli suggesting that different mucus types are produced by L. pertusa. Mucus produced to reject particles is similar in refractive index to the surrounding seawater, suggesting that the energy content of this mucus is low. In contrast, mucus produced in response to either food particle addition or air exposure had a higher refractive index, suggesting a higher metabolic investment in the production of these mucoid substances. This paper shows for the first time the potential of DHM technology for the detection, characterization and quantification of mucus production through OPD measurements in L. pertusa.},

Study findings and management experience in the Great Lakes will benefit the water resource managers in the western United States and help them be better prepared to act quickly and effectively to mitigate mussel impacts. We investigated the impacts of dreissenid mussels on nutrients and plankton using a two-dimensional Ecological model of Lake Eric (EcoLE), and compared their impacts with those of mesozooplankters. Model results showed that in the shallow western basin, mussel daily grazing impact was less than 10\% of the combined Non-Diatom Edible Algae (NDEA) and diatom biomass, although they cleared a volume equivalent to 20\% of the water column daily. Moreover, in the deep central and eastern basins, dreissenids grazed only 1-2\% of the NDEA and diatom biomass per day. The relative importance of dreissenids' grazing impact on diatoms and NDEA to those of zooplankton's varied among years and basins in Lake Eric. In general, zooplankton had slightly higher grazing impacts than did the mussels on NDEA and diatoms in the western basin but much higher grazing impacts in the central basin. Dreissenid mussels excreted a big portion of phosphorus in the bottom water, especially in the western basin, while zooplankton kept a big portion of algal phosphorus in the water column, especially in the central and eastern basins. Non-Diatom Inedible Algae (NDIA) abundance increased with more phosphorus available and was less responsive to mussel selective grazing. Dreissenid mussels affected crustacean zooplankton mainly through their impacts on NDEA. Our results thus indicate that dreissenid mussels have weak direct grazing impacts on algal biomass due to a concentration boundary layer above the mussel bed, while their indirect effects through nutrient excretion have much greater and profound negative impacts on the system. EcoLE is a modification of CE-QUAL-W2, which is frequently applied to western aquatic systems, and we suggest that with this modification, the models can be used to predict dreissenid impacts in western lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in which they may become established.},

We obtained five pairs of bacterial strains, within each of which the two strains could coexist stably. We then allowed the bacterial strains to evolve in a chemically defined nutrient medium for \texttildelow 1100 generations, under sympatric (in two-strain mixtures) or allopatric scenarios (in monocultures). The strength of coexistence mechanisms was assessed based on reciprocal invasion assays and measurements of environmental carrying capacity.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n* Our data confirmed that coexistence could be weaken by either fitness difference or niche overlap among competitors. In allopatrically evolved strain pairs, fitness difference among competitors became larger or unchanged; and the magnitude of niche overlap often showed an increase rather than a decline. Sympatrically evolved competitors showed no consistent changing trend in the strength of the coexistence mechanisms. Overall, sympatrically evolved competitor pairs did not differ from allopatrically evolved ones in the magnitude of fitness difference, but had lower levels of niche overlap.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n* The results are consistent with the `character displacement' view that allopatric populations of competing species occupy more similar niche space compared with sympatric populations. However, the pattern observed here resulted from allopatrically evolved competitors showing niche convergence, but not sympatrically evolved competitors consistently showing further niche divergence. The results also suggest that convergent evolution in allopatry followed by secondary contacts is an unlikely mechanism for the origin of `neutral communities'.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n},

In modelled food webs, horizontal and vertical diversity increased and decreased stability, respectively, with a stronger positive effect of producer diversity on stability at higher consumer diversity. Experiments with an empirical plankton food web, where we manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity and measured stability from species interactions and from resilience against large perturbations, confirmed these predictions. Taken together, our findings highlight the need to conserve horizontal biodiversity at different trophic levels to ensure stability.},

Warmer temperatures were associated with lower structural and temporal stability, while biodiversity had no consistent effects on either stability property. While species richness was associated with lower structural stability and higher temporal stability, Simpson diversity was associated with higher temporal stability. The responses of structural stability were linked to disproportionate contributions from two trophic groups (predators and consumers), while the responses of temporal stability were linked both to synchrony of all species within the food web and distinctive contributions from three trophic groups (predators, consumers, and producers). Our results suggest that, in natural ecosystems, warmer temperatures can erode ecosystem stability, while biodiversity changes may not have consistent effects.}

We screened phylogenetic trees reconstructed for each of these extended gene families for highly supported monophyly of cyanobacteria (or lack of it). Cyanobacterial genomes reveal a complex evolutionary history, which cannot be represented by a single strictly bifurcating tree for all genes or even most genes, although a single completely resolved phylogeny was recovered from the quartets' plurality signals. We find more conflicts within cyanobacteria than between cyanobacteria and other phyla. We also find that genes from all functional categories are subject to transfer. However, in interphylum as compared to intraphylum transfers, the proportion of metabolic (operational) gene transfers increases, while the proportion of informational gene transfers decreases.},

Such a change is likely to affect the distribution and diversity of submerged macrophytes. Filter-feeding by these mussels has been associated with increased water clarity in many North American and European lakes. In this study, we report the increase in water clarity of Oneida Lake, New York, USA, for 1975\textendash 2002 and argue that the increase was caused by zebra mussel invasion rather than declines in nutrients. Over the study period, although mean total phosphorus decreased significantly, the main increase in water clarity occurred after the zebra mussel invasion in 1991. The average depth receiving 1\% surface light increased from 6.7 m to 7.8 m after the invasion of zebra mussels, representing a 23\% areal expansion. The maximum depth of macrophyte colonization, as measured by diver and hydroacoustic surveys, increased from 3.0 m before the invasion of zebra mussels to 5.1 m after their establishment. In addition, macrophyte species richness increased, the frequency of occurrence increased for most species, and the composition of the macrophyte community changed from low-light\textendash tolerant species to those tolerating a wide range of light conditions. Comparisons with observations reported in the literature indicate that increased light penetration alone could explain these changes in macrophyte distribution and diversity. Such changes will increase the importance of benthic primary production over pelagic production in the food web, thereby representing an overall alteration of ecosystem function, a process we refer to as ``benthification''.},

In the early period of expansion beyond its native range in the Dnieper-Bug delta and estuary, D. bugensis rapidly replaced Dreissena polymorpha in the upper Dnieper River system, but increased only gradually and over time became less abundant relative to D. polymorpha in the Don-Manych River system. Contrary to the Dnieper and Don River systems, in the Volga River system considerable spatial variability in relative abundances was apparent, particularly in northern reservoirs. Moreover, even though D. bugensis usually displaces D. polymorpha as the dominant dreissenid, the latter can remain dominant in certain types of habitats where conditions are less favourable for the former. Suggested factors that may be responsible for differences in invasion patterns in the river systems may include differential responses to temperature, or to some other factor(s) associated with geographical latitude, the level of water mineralization, and selective predation by molluscivorous fish. In particular, the northward expansion of D. bugensis seems to be limited by temperature. The lack of long-term data on appropriate scales precludes linking these differences to specific features within the environment, but our comparisons indicate that the expansion of D. bugensis relative to D. polymorpha is more complex than previously believed.},

  abstract = {Background: The ecological effects of phenolic compounds in plant tissues are related to their phenolic signature, i.e. the total content and structure of the phenolic compounds. Although the spatial and temporal variation of the phenolic signature within species is well documented, it remains unclear whether intraspecific variation is due to genetic differences between individuals or to environmental conditions. Aims: We aimed to disentangle the effects of the genetic background and environmental conditions on intraspecific variation in the phenolic signature of beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaf litter. Methods: In a silvicultural provenance experiment, beech populations from a wide range of the natural distribution range of the species, including different phylogeographic lineages (site of origin = genetic background), were grown in two geographically distinct common gardens (site of growth = environment). The total content and the protein-precipitation capacity of phenolic leaf litter compounds and their HPLC profile were determined as a measure of the phenolic signature of leaf litter of individual beech trees. Results: The phenolic content and the protein-precipitating capacity of methanolic litter extracts were significantly correlated. Variation in the content of phenolic compounds was largely related to genetic background and less to environment, while the reverse was true for their protein-precipitating capacity. Individuals grown in the same common garden exhibited more similar phenolic signatures than individuals from the same provenance but grown at different locations. Conclusions: We conclude that it is environmental conditions rather than the genetic background that determines the phenolic signature of leaf litter of beech individuals. It follows from our results that environmental change may in the future lead to alteration of the phenolic signatures of present beech forest ecosystems, probably with a cascading effect on ecological processes such as decomposition. \textcopyright{} 2014, \textcopyright{} 2014 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor \& Francis.},

We addressed this issue in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, a highly successful model system in cell and molecular biology. We found that this species has a distribution that is restricted to the Eastern United States, with high diversity in the northeast and low diversity across the rest of its distribution. We find high levels of population subdivision, low rates of migration and significant isolation by distance, supporting the moderate endemicity model of protist biogeography. This restricted gene flow may be a result of small population size, which would reduce the probability of migration events, or the inability to establish after migration. This work lays the foundation for T. thermophila to become a valuable model system for studying population biology. \textcopyright{} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Changes in plant community traits along an environmental gradient are caused by interspecific and intraspecific trait variation. However, little is known about the role of interspecific and intraspecific trait variation in plant community responses to the restoration of a sandy grassland ecosystem. We measured five functional traits of 34 species along a restoration gradient of sandy grassland (mobile dune, semi-fixed dune, fixed dune, and grassland) in Horqin Sand Land, northern China. We examined how community-level traits varied with habitat changes and soil gradients using both abundance-weighted and non-weighted averages of trait values. We quantified the relative contribution of inter- and intraspecific trait variation in specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf carbon content (LCC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and plant height to the community response to habitat changes in the restoration of sandy grassland. We found that five weighted community-average traits varied significantly with habitat changes. Along the soil gradient in the restoration of sandy grassland, plant height, SLA, LDMC, and LCC increased, while LNC decreased. For all traits, there was a greater contribution of interspecific variation to community response in regard to habitat changes relative to that of intraspecific variation. The relative contribution of the interspecific variation effect of an abundance-weighted trait was greater than that of a non-weighted trait with regard to all traits except LDMC. A community-level trait response to habitat changes was due largely to species turnover. Though the intraspecific shift plays a small role in community trait response to habitat changes, it has an effect on plant coexistence and the maintenance of herbaceous plants in sandy grassland habitats. The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific variation further suggests that both effects of inter- and intraspecific variation on a community trait should be considered when understanding a plant community response to environmental changes in sandy grassland ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {Despite slow nutrient supply to the subtropical surface ocean, the rates of annual inorganic carbon uptake and net oxygen production are similar to those of nutrient-rich high-latitude waters. This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are key tools to mitigate human impacts in coastal environments, promoting sustainable activities to conserve biodiversity. The designation of MPAs alone may not result in the lessening of some human threats, which is highly dependent on management goals and the related specific regulations that are adopted. Here, we develop and operationalize a local threat assessment framework. We develop indices to quantify the effectiveness of MPAs (or individual zones within MPAs in the case of multiple-use MPAs) in reducing anthropogenic extractive and non-extractive threats operating at local scale, focusing specifically on threats that can be managed through MPAs. We apply this framework in 15 Mediterranean MPAs to assess their threat reduction capacity. We show that fully protected areas effectively eliminate extractive activities, whereas the intensity of artisanal and recreational fishing within partially protected areas, paradoxically, is higher than that found outside MPAs, questioning their ability at reaching conservation targets. In addition, both fully and partially protected areas attract non-extractive activities that are potential threats. Overall, only three of the 15 MPAs had lower intensities for the entire set of eight threats considered, in respect to adjacent control unprotected areas. Understanding the intensity and occurrence of human threats operating at the local scale inside and around MPAs is important for assessing MPAs effectiveness in achieving the goals they have been designed for, informing management strategies, and prioritizing specific actions.},

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific diversity buffers populations from deleterious impacts of environmental change. Nevertheless, the consequences of climate warming for phenotypic and genetic diversity within populations and species remain poorly understood. The goal of our study was to explore among-year variations in the phenotypic structure of populations and their relationships with climate variability and population dynamics. We analysed multiyear (1992\textendash 2018) data on colour morph frequencies within populations of the leaf beetle, Chrysomela lapponica, from multiple sites in the Kola Peninsula (northwestern Russia). We observed a strong decline in the proportion of dark (melanic) morphs among overwintered beetles during the study period; this decline was consistent across all study sites. Using model selection procedures, we explained declines in the dark morph of overwintered beetles by increases in minimum spring (May\textendash June) daily temperatures. Other climatic characteristics, pollution load, and beetle population density were unrelated to variation in colour morph frequencies. Among newly emerged beetles (August), dark morph frequencies also decreased with an increase in average spring temperatures, but were unrelated to mean temperatures during the larval development period (July). These results suggest that the two-fold decline in dark morph frequencies during the past 26 years has been driven by the 2.5 \textdegree C increase in spring temperatures, most likely because dark males lose the mating advantages over light males that they obtain during cold springs. The continued loss of dark morphs and related decrease in within-population diversity may render leaf beetle populations more vulnerable to future environmental changes, in particular to those expressed in extreme weather fluctuations. Our study demonstrates that declines in within-population diversity are already underway in subarctic areas, and that these declines are likely driven by climate warming.},

The genetically diverse nature of each genus is likely an important reason for their successful colonization of vast tracts of the world's oceans, a feature that has led to detailed analysis of the distribution of these genetic lineages at the local and ocean basin scale. Here, we extend these analyses to the global dimension, using new data from cruises in the Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans in combination with data from previous studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and a circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere to form a data set which comprises most of the world's major ocean systems. We show that the distribution patterns of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages are remarkably similar in different ocean systems with comparable environmental conditions, but producing a strikingly different `signature' in the four major ocean domains or biomes (the Polar Domain, Coastal Boundary Domain, Trade Winds Domain and Westerly Winds Domain). This clearly reiterates the idea of spatial partitioning of individual cyanobacterial lineages, but at the global scale.},
